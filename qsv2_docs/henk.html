The second floor of a Southern Cross Endoscopy wing was rolling and bouncing. People, TVs, pot plants, magazine racks, filing cabinets, computers and monitors fell over amidst screams of patients and staff. Then silence… before emotions took over and people started to get to their feet. Amazingly I was still glued to the wall.
I hugged a receptionist who was crying, scared for her aged mother who was home alone. “Everybody needs to get out of the building!” I yelled. Nobody moved at first, then slowly people started to make their way to the exit stairs.
I spared a quick thought for the unfortunate soul who may have been undergoing a colonoscopy, ran to my car and raced towards home. I rang my wife on my her mobile and was connected, but only heard her screams as I was trying to avoid the liquefaction and the flooding of the roads. Roared past The Palms, people everywhere from the mall and the surrounding schools…I was scared my wife was hurt. Then I heard the neighbour’s voice over the phone and I knew my wife was all right.
