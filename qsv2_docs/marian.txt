Sept. 4th, coming home from work at Dunsandel to my home in Rolleston at 10.pm. I noticed how clear and bright the night sky was as I drove. Cup of tea, then to bed.  Early hours of the morning woken to what I thought was a huge gust of wind blowing around the house, but then side to side in our bed, then up and down then the noise, that evil noise, I’m screaming, couldn’t move, what is it? what is it? and from what seemed 2 rooms away (although he was next to me) came the words “its an earthquake, a ******* big earthquake” Glass breaking, fish tank over, pantry emptied, TV over, car and house alarms screaming, then darkness, and silence.  Neighbours gathering everyone pale and crying, then the after shocks, they would not stop. 5 months of continual uneasiness, starting to accept we’ve been through the worst, then Feb 22, the pain and loss of that day will never leave my soul, I have never felt so humble. We are only guests of mother nature. Be strong Canterbury we can do this.
