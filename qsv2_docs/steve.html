I cannot believe my luck, living as I do in Woolston, in the Eastern suburbs. There was no damage to my place save for a small knickknack that  fell off my china cabinet in the Sept 2010 quake and broke in two and a largish china Pegasus fell and broke into large pieces in the Feb 2011 quake. This I glued back up and if you do not look too closely you would not know it broke.
I know there was fear, despair and depression, but part of the truth is that some had none of this.  Not even during the tremors themselves. I was one of these, and I have no idea why. For I am not a brave man by nature, In fact I regard myself as a craven coward
I do not wish to appear to be gloating. But I do wish to testify to an experience that has not even, it seems, been noticed
