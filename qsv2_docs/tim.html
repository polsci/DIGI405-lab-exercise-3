I was in our offices in the Strategy Building on the 3rd floor when the February quake hit. I was walking back to my desk and was 3-4m away when i realised this was more than just another aftershock. I went to take 2 big strides to get under my desk and hit a wall which was in completely another direction!
I spent the entire time on my feet in some way watching ceiling tiles fall and glass shatter. Once the shaking stopped it was time to get everyone out calmly and quickly. I went out to the main stairwell which was now hanging about a metre away from the building. In our main foyer there were people from other offices who i got through our office to the fire escape.
I grabbed my jacket, which immediatly felt heavy and felt yes – wallet, keys, phone. Thank god. I’m outta here …. tbc
