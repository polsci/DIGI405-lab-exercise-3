Greetings to you all.
Distinguished guests
Ladies and Gentlemen
I am very pleased to join you today at the 24th Nikkei Forum, and to follow such illustrious speakers, to contribute a New Zealand perspective to this Forum.  I would like to thank the organisers of the Nikkei Forum for their invitation.
What happens in Asia is of vital interest and concern to New Zealand. 
So much of what we deal with in government today is regional if not global in nature. To achieve prosperity and stability, we must act together.
The Government I represent came into office in New Zealand just nine months ago, led by our young, clever and progressive Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern who is due to give birth to her first child any day.
We are an outward looking country.
Like previous New Zealand governments we recognise the importance of this region.  New Zealand has long-standing ties with many Asian countries. Today, 12% of the people of New Zealand are Asian born or have Asian ancestry and a similar number have links to Pacific nations, making us both a diverse as well as an outward-looking people.
That underscores the partnership we feel, and strive to improve, with the nations of the Asian-Pacific or Indo-Asian as you now call it. 
Security Challenges
Just as our heritage is bound up with Asia, so too is our future.
Firstly, we share many of the same security challenges and opportunities.  There is no doubt that the eyes of the world are on this region.  What happens on the Korean Peninsula, in the South China Sea, in areas threatened by terrorism and instability, matters to New Zealand.
The risks to global peace and security are growing and the rules-based system is under pressure.  New Zealand has always been willing to contribute to UN sanctioned collective action to restore and maintain peace.  We are also committed to nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.
We stand ready to support further efforts towards the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula following this week’s critical summit meeting. 
CPTPP and general trade policy
New Zealand also shares with Asia many of the same economic challenges and opportunities.
As a small trading nation that relies on access to markets and foreign capital, New Zealand has worked for many years with our neighbours in Asia to promote trade and economic connectivity and openness.
This year I joined Minister Motegi, Minister Guajardo and eight other trade and economic ministers to sign CPTPP.  That was the culmination of many years of work to draw together in a trade agreement countries from both sides of the Pacific.  I thank Japan in particular for the leadership shown to ensure we succeeded in bringing the agreement to its conclusion at a time when leadership in trade was critically important.  Very soon, after it enters into force, CPTPP will...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic)
