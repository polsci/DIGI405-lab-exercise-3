Introduction 
I’m pleased to host Te Māngai Paho’s 25th Anniversary here at Parliament alongside Dr Eruera Tarena, Chair of Te Māngai Pāho. 
Te Māngai Pāho has been instrumental in supporting innovation and the creation of content that promotes our reo and culture. Congratulations on 25 years! 
We know that te reo Māori broadcasting and online content can provide broad exposure to the language and enhance the way people value it.  
But there is something special about the way we think about and develop content. There’s no one way, in fact. The way people consume media is changing, and this is being driven by rapidly advancing technology.
We can choose to access te reo Māori content at home, walking to work, on the bus or plane and through platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram, You Tube, radio, television …. And the list goes on. Where ever, whenever!
But at the heart of all this is a Māori Perspective with our culture, language and identity forming a nexus of creativity and innovation.  Māori media sector shift
As I undertake the Māori Media Sector Shift. I have been working in close collaboration with Te Māngai Pāho, Pouaka whakatā Māori (who recently celebrated their 20 years) and Te Taura Whiri i te reo Māori. This work sits alongside work led by the Minister for Broadcasting, Communication and Digital Media, Kris Faafoi.
The impetus for the Māori Media Sector Shift is to position a new reality of digital content audience led and make it accessible in different forms. We require greater ability to promote te reo me ona tikanga, to engage our audiences, and to tell Māori stories effectively in the modern media environment. For example:
Living by the Stars by Dr Rangimataamua
Whānau Living
Pipi Mā

I’m also mindful that for a strategic shift to occur we need existing contributors to content such as iwi radio, Māori Television Service, Māori content producers and all the talent that sits in this space to join the conversation and figure out the step change we need. 
The rapidly changing broadcasting and media environment is setting new challenges and creating new opportunities to develop te reo Māori content on a variety of platforms. 
These platforms will not only promote the use of te reo Māori but also effect positive change in people’s ability to speak confidently, embrace a Māori worldview and deepen the character of our country’s national identity. 
In recognising rangatahi and young people as the future, it is crucial that they see te reo Māori as being relevant in their lives and helping shape their identity. 
I want them to be excited about the opportunities they can create and access because of te reo Māori, and the gateway to opportunity it provides to other peoples and their culture here and abroad.
More than 84 percent of our rangatahi want to improve their reo. Fifty six percent are using the internet and social media to connect with their language and culture. In a post settlement context access to language content provides a tangible link between iwi and their tribal membership no matter where they live around the world. 
This is why entities such as Te Māngai Pāho matter. 
The government’s ongoing commitment to the aspirations of Te Whare o Te Reo Mauriora was clearly demonstrated last month through the Wellbeing Budget which secured $33.84 million over four years for the continued revitalisation of te reo Māori. Innovative Te Reo Māori Media
A further $14 million of the Wellbeing Budget funds are allocated specifically to Te Māngai Pāho to increase engagement with te reo Māori on broadcast and online platforms. 
This will be done through providing funding for Te Māngai Pāho to purchase new and innovative media content, in collaboration with the wider Māori Media sector and for iwi radio and the Māori Television Service. I hope you welcome the focus as an incentive towards a content rich future and smart collaboration.
The content produced will have a particular focus on rangatahi audiences, and will be delivered across a range of platforms and in partnership with iwi and our Māori media communities. 
As we shift our efforts to implementing the Maihi Karauna, Te Māngai Pāho is one of the key contributors to effect change.Conclusion
Twenty five years ago Te Māngai Pāho accepted the challenge to increase the use of te reo in the broadcasting media.
In that time, there have been some very notable advances. We are seeing New Zealanders expressing their enthusiasm for te reo Māori like never before.
I have no doubt that broadcasting, and the work funded by Te Māngai Pāho, has played a significant part in this. 
I am equally sure Te Māngai Pāho will meet its new challenges and opportunities with the same bold approach with an opportunity to leverage further innovation. 
It takes this type of leadership to pioneer different approaches.  So to Eruera, Larry and the Board of Te Māngai Pāho. Happy 25th Anniversary!  ENDS
