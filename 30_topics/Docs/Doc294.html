‘Change versus a Modified Status Quo’
Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.
Introduction
Thank you to Grant Thornton for the invitation to address you here today about the ‘Wellbeing Budget’ and what it will mean for New Zealand businesses. Today also presents an opportunity to discuss how the Coalition Government is delivering on its promises half way through its term. That discussion will go to the very essence of what change means.
You’ll recall that on Thursday 19 October, 2017, New Zealand First announced its decision to enter into a coalition agreement with the Labour Party. After nine years of drift and growing social deficits, we said on that October night that for too many New Zealanders capitalism had come to be viewed as not their friend but their foe. 
We said capitalism had to regain its human face otherwise the types of political and economic disruptions we see all around the world would visit our shores.  
What lay behind our choice? In a word: history.
Our last major disruption occurred in July 1984, 35 years ago, when the Fourth Labour Government came to power. Some 17 months earlier a Labor Party also came to power in Australia. What stands out when comparing the two approaches is the Rogernomes preference for an unmandated policy blitzkrieg over the more measured and consensual approach adopted by Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. 
Their consultative approach carried major sector groups and the Australian public with them. In New Zealand Douglas’ approach exalted in the opposite until they became addicted to big change at the expense of any common sense or common decency.  What was the result from these two very different approaches to leading big change? Thirty five years later the Australian GDP per capita has in real terms grown over 30 percent more than New Zealand’s.
We also warned in October 2017 that our negotiations had taken place against a backdrop of changing international and internal economic circumstances which couldn’t be ignored. At the same time and in that same speech we warned of dark clouds on the horizon and an economic slowdown world-wide, and that the first signs of it already existed:
A housing market slowdown;
Reserve Bank and trading bank nervousness;
The cessation of hot money into our economy;
Property ownership concerns, and;
Receding consumer confidence and ebbing retailer confidence.
So, there were great risks in whatever decision we made and despite our having had no influence on these risks, we knew some would attempt to heap the blame on us. That those blame caricatures were both spurious and misplaced in our view wouldn’t stop attempts to mischaracterise the cause of events. 
We put that scenario out front then, and do so now, so that misplaced culpability attempts, and they have been continuous since we formed the coalition, would fail. Those predicted headwinds, now with us, affected our decision to govern with Labour because we had to decide how to best mitigate, not worsen, their impact on as many New Zealanders as possible.
The Essence of Change
In entering a coalition with Labour we made a deliberate choice for change over a modified status quo. The ‘Wellbeing Budget’ justifies the choice New Zealand First made that evening. Putting a human face on capitalism was central to that choice and we’ve delivered it. 
The ‘Wellbeing’ announcements discussed today could only have been made by a Labour-New Zealand First Coalition Government. Policies for economic growth, turning our exporting decline around, taking mental health seriously, breaking the cycle on child poverty and domestic violence and investing in national infrastructure would not have been possible under a modified status quo controlled by National. 
We’ve sought as a government to tackle the long-term economic and social challenges facing New Zealand and prepare the country’s workforce for the jobs of an information-age, 21st Century global economy. These challenges are not insignificant. After nine years of these social ills and economic fundamentals being ignored by National, New Zealand First remains proud of its preference for social cohesion over conflict, and change over doing nothing. 
Which brings me to a reflection about the nature of change. Change is not easy. It disrupts, upsets and unsettles those who benefit from the previous status quo. We understand that which is why our change programme is a considered and planned one. It won’t happen overnight and will take multiple terms for our changes to be locked in.
  In part that is because we inherited the laissez-faire neglect that nine years of a National Government produced. It is mostly because we intend to take New Zealanders with us. That we have studied how enduring change happens over the past forty years. 
While conditions can lead to big change, as we saw with the Fourth Labour Government’s revolution, and then endured further through Ruthanasia, launching transformational change without mandate or by not bringing people with you leads to unintended consequences: political cynicism, social and economic upheaval, and a lost generation of New Zealanders who were arrogantly deemed to be no longer economically viable. 
We’ve been living with the consequences of that disruption ever since. So while Beltway commentators and neo-liberal partisans decry the Coalition Government’s carefully managed programme of change – with headlines like ‘Last throw of dice for Government running out of time’ and ‘New Zealand slowdown could limit wellbeing’ – we say our changes will endure because the people support them. We say that unless we all share in the land of plenty then it’s not change worth ha...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic)
