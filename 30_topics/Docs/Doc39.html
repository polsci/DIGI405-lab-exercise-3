Tena koutou katoa
Greetings to you all.
Sir Doug Kidd, President, New Zealand Institute of International Affairs – thank you for the invitation to speak.
Maty Nikkhou-O’Brien, Executive Director, New Zealand Institute of International Affairs – thank you for the welcome. I’d like to acknowledge the work you are doing through the Institute to expand the range of people participating in the debate about foreign affairs and New Zealand role in the world. 
This is my first formal speech on issues relating to international relations, but not my first encounter with it. In fact, the relevance and importance of our place in the world, and the clues to navigating such significant global disruption, have always started at home. 
I spent some of my early childhood during the 80s in a small town in the Bay of Plenty called Murupara, before moving to the dairy farming town of Morrinsville.  It would be easy to feel isolated from the world, impervious to what was happening around you.  But the size of the town has rarely isolated anyone from the reverberations of international events. The removal of tariff protections right through to the 1987 stock exchange crash all had their impact. 
And just as globalisation has been felt through the past few decades, so too will the effects of next industrial revolution and the changing nature of work. 
I raise this, not as an attempt to be a futurist, but because we ignore the interaction of global developments on our domestic population at our peril. Overseas experience, and our own, tells us that if we want to retain the values of being outward looking, engaged in global institutions, welcoming of trade and direct investment, we must build the social licence for that. 
We’re not alone in that thinking. The last APEC meeting in Viet Nam for instance had a strong focus on creating greater inclusiveness around the trade agenda. We want to take that a step further. 
Trade
Trade will always be an essential part of our engagement with other countries. 
Better market access for our exporters and growing New Zealand businesses internationally are critical parts of our economic strategy. But how we develop and pursue that trade agenda also matters. 
The CPTPP for instance will deliver benefits to the economy of up to $4 billion a year, but we had to fight hard to carve out our investor screening from ISDS clauses and to also preserve our right to regulate the purchase of residential homes by foreign buyers. 
The experience of watching the early interactions of TPP, and being part of the final negotiations taught me a lot. It reaffirmed my belief that trade has the ability to support sustainable, productive and inclusive growth IF that is the agenda you enter negotiations with. That is why you will see us establish a different framework for trade negotiations, one where we more openly pursue the interests of our regions, SMEs, Maori and women.
We are also focused on taking a more open and consultative approach. 
Not only it is important that New Zealanders feel that open trade with the world delivers more benefits than harm, that has to be the reality too. 
But this will be just one of the possible points of difference you’ll detect in our approach to international issues. 
Being a child of the 80s affected me in many ways (and unfortunately there are photos to prove it) and that included international events. Rather than just reading about the impact of apartheid in South Africa for instance, or nuclear testing in the Pacific, I saw instead each of these issues through the lens of our response. They weren’t history lessons, they were lessons in our values, what mattered to us, and that our size bore no relation to the impact our voice could ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (%
