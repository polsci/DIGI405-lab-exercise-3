Tēnā tātou katoa
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to say a few words at your 2018 National Conference. It’s a real pleasure to be here at Victoria University of Wellington [as a former educator myself].
I acknowledge the important role that the United Nations Association of New Zealand plays in raising public awareness about the United Nations.  
New Zealand’s foreign policy has long been characterised by the strength of its independent voice. That voice has been strongest when New Zealand’s deeply held values are projected onto the world stage.
New Zealand has been a consistent supporter of the international rules-based system and was, as you all know, a founding member of the United Nations. 
Our interests are best served by such a system where conflict, trans-border and global challenges are addressed collectively, utilising multilateral rules and institutions.
Having international rules and standards provides stability, certainty and protection. 
For a small, geographically isolated nation like New Zealand, our security and well-being depends on global stability, underpinned by rules and norms that also reflect our national values.   
It is no secret that the United Nations and the broader international rules-based system are under serious strain and face many, complex challenges.
As the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Right Honourable Winston Peters, said recently “we are at a turning point where the importance of protecting our interests in the face of converging geo-political and trade challenges is ever greater, as global rules are under threat, and as geopolitical changes are calling into question the primacy of the system”.
We see these strains in the repeated failure of the United Nations Security Council to agree on measures to end major conflicts such as the conflict in Syria, where even getting critically needed humanitarian assistance to war-torn communities has been extremely difficult.    
New Zealand saw first-hand the impact of the major power dynamics at play while serving on the Security Council in 2015 and 2016. 
Early this month was the second anniversary of Security Council Resolution 2286 on healthcare in armed conflict. New Zealand played a leading role in the development and negotiation of the Resolution and it passed unanimously even though humanitarian access continues to be limited.
In addition to Syria, there are a number of examples where major power dynamics has prevented the Security Council from being able to agree on effective action. These include Yemen, Libya, Western Sahara, Darfur and in South Sudan, where David Shearer is doing an admirable job leading the UN peacekeeping mission – one of the toughest jobs out there in the UN system.
Since the establishment of the United Nations, as you know New Zealand has been a passionate advocate against the veto in the Security Council. 
Even more pervasive than the use of the veto is the “threat” of the veto, which is often used on controversial issues to block discussions before they even start.  New Zealand has worked with other Member States to support initiatives aimed at curtailing the use of the veto, particularly in situations involving mass atrocities. We shouldn’t kid ourselves, but these initiatives are slowly building real momentum among the broader UN membership.
As major reforms to the structure of the Security Council are unlikely anytime soon, a key focus for New Zealand has been on operational changes to improve the Council’s working methods.
While on the Council, New Zealand encouraged a strong focus on concrete, practical outcomes, such as using Council statements and Council visits as conflict prevention tools.  We encouraged greater transparency and consultation with key stakeholders, including affected countries, regional organisations, such as the African Union, as well as the countries that contribute large numbers of troops to UN peacekeeping operations. 
New Zealand also reinforced the role of the 10 non-permanent members of the Council and challenged some of the practices of the five permanent members, including their dominance of the drafting of Council resolutions and the way that work is allocated to non-permanent members.  New Zealand secured important outcomes in these areas.
There is a lot of talk, as you know, about the dominance of the permanent five members of the Security Council and the abuse of the use of the veto, and rightfully so. We have seen the veto – and implicit threat of the veto – used recently for instance to block accountability mechanisms for alleged chemical weapons attacks in Syria. But the elected members also have a significant role. Together they make up the majority of the Council. Collectively they have enormous power,...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic)
