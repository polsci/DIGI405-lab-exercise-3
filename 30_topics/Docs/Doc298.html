The Ministry for the Environment’s environmental attitudes research shows that New Zealanders believe that dealing with waste is the second equal most pressing issue facing our country over the next 20 years. Poverty is number one.
Incredibly, New Zealand is currently one of the highest producers of urban waste in the developed world per capita. 
The news is full of stories about plastic pollution in our oceans, stockpiling of low value plastic waste, illegal dumping, tyre mountains and occasional fires from waste stockpiles; and what happens when landfills are poorly sited and maintained. Once upon a time it was out of sight, out of mind. 
Our waste ‘indicators’ are generally heading in the wrong direction with more not less waste going to landfill.
This situation challenges how we see ourselves as a country, how the world sees us, and the future we want for our children.
As a country we need to turn around our rubbish record on waste.
Government’s role is to set direction, provide leadership and put in place supporting regulations, incentives and investment. 
Business and industry have a critical role to play by looking closely at their supply chains, manufacturing and retail operations to reduce the waste they create, manage their own waste better, and offer consumers genuine choices of lower-impact packaging and goods.
And of course consumers make important decisions about how they run their households, the products they buy, and what they do with those products at the end of their life.
But even with everyone doing their individual best to reduce waste we still won’t crack the problem entirely. 
To effectively deal with waste we need some fundamental changes in how we think about and use nature and the resources that nature provides us and how we think about waste.
Our existing economic model is essentially one of taking the resources we want from nature, making them into stuff we can use, and then throwing those items away when they break, go out of fashion or our wants change. And we package products unnecessarily for convenience and presentation – packaging that goes directly to landfill at best, or at worst pollutes the environment.
Designers and manufacturers of products and packaging have typically taken very little care or responsibility for what happens to their products at the end of their life. 
Today, expectations are changing. If a business creates a product or packaging, it needs to give some thought to, and take increased responsibility for, what happens to it at the end of its life. Consumers are calling for this loud and clear, and many businesses are starting to make changes. 
We are on the cusp of a paradigm shift. The trajectory is that as a country we need to move away from the single-use, take, make and dispose model and towards a low emissions, circular economy where we take carefully from nature, make, use, then recover materials so they can be collected, remade or recycled, to keep valuable resources in our supply chains and out of landfills.  
This is not just about mitigating the environmental impacts of waste. It is an important economic shift as well. 
The circular economy model is a system shift to a more efficient and resilient economy; one where there is less separation between people and planet.
We have one planet and currently we humans are over using its biomass, its water, its capacity to absorb pollutants and its oceans. When we mine minerals, take resources such as sand for glass, oil for plastic we need to keep those resources in circulation and providing jobs and livelihoods for people, rather than let them literally go to waste. 
Until last year, China was the world’s largest importer of recyclable products. In February 2018 China enforced its ‘National Sword’ policy aimed at restricting the importation of low quality recyclable materials. The policy has resulted in an oversupply of some recyclable products to other overseas markets and a decline in international commodity prices – which is having significant impacts on New Zealand’s resource recovery industry. 
Mixed, low value plastics and mixed fibre commodities, such as paper and card were particularly hard hit and this represents a significant challenge for many Councils and businesses. Ten councils have stopped, or are about to stop, collecting plastics 3-7. On the fibre issue, two of New Zealand’s largest councils have had to bail out their recyclers.
The need to take more responsibility for the waste we create has been highlighted by recent international negotiations. New Zealand and about 180 other countries, have agreed to amend the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. 
This means that exporters of contaminated or hard-to-recycle types of plastic waste will need a consent from the governments of the countries they are exporting to, before shipping.  The amendment to the Basel Convention will make global trade in plastic waste more transparent and better regulated, while also ensuring its management is safer for human health and the environment.
China’s National Sword has highlight the vulnerability of our recycling system to the volatility of the international markets. 
The need to concentrate on developing onshore recycling infrastructure has never been more in focus. We can no longer expect to send our waste away and have others to deal with it (including more than 40,000 tonnes annually of plastics from New Zealand, the majority of which went to China before National Sword). We need to invest in more onshore innovation, infrastructure and reprocessing capacity here in New Zealand to recover and re-use materials. 
Last month I announced our plan to help recharge New Zealand’s resource recovery and recycling sector as part of our response to China’s National Sword. Many of you have and are working closely with the Ministry for Environment team on this programme of work.
Government does not have all the solutions but from July the Ministry will be implementing all of the recommendations from the taskforce on resource recovery which was established last year. Currently there is no standardised template contract across councils and recycling and materials recovery operations. This has contributed to the plethora of systems, inconsistency in what materials are recovered, and what level of contamination is acceptable.
