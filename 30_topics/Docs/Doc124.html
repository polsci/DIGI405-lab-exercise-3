LGNZ Annual Conference Speech
Hon Nanaia Mahuta
Minister for Local Government
E ngā maramara o te takere waka nui, tēnā koutou.
Ko Ranginui e tū iho nei,
Ko Papatuānuku e takoto nei
Ka mawhiti te titiro ki kō Tiritiri o te Moana, arā,
Tū mai Aoraki me te whakanikoniko a huka kei tō kaahu,
Hei tawharau i a mātou i tēnei wā, Kai Tahu koutou nō tēnei pito ō te motu. Nga timimate o te wā, o te marama ,o nanahi hāere hoki mai hāere. Tatu iho nei ki a tātou ngā mahue tanga iho.  Tēnā koutou katoa, Pai Mārire.

This is my first opportunity as Minister for Local Government to attend an annual conference and I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge Hon Jenny Salesa , parliamentary colleagues, SOLGM ,Local Government New Zealand President David Cull, members of the National Council, Mayor Lianne Dalziel, and other mayors, chairs, and local government leaders who have played a role in organizing or are attending this event.
Introduction
I am pleased that the Minister of Finance and Climate Change have preceded my presentation because you will appreciate that we are thinking about the big challenges ahead as we respond to pressures for growth, protecting and enhancing our environment, strengthening our resilience and ensuring that all our people can contribute to and share in the prosperity of our country, people, cities and communities.
We are on a journey which in my mind requires us to work differently and in a way that builds a critical partnership and takes account of our respective roles at central and local government levels. We are looking for a different outcome. There is no single solution to the challenge of improving the wellbeing of our people and communities.
This is a new way of doing things because we need cut through to some significant challenges. It will require strategic vision and leadership with a system wide approach that corresponds in an ecosystem of multiple challenges and opportunities.
Ministerial priorities
Many of the Government’s priorities, especially in the areas of regional development, housing, infrastructure, fresh water and climate change, require alignment to achieve national objectives with local benefits. In order to achieve this we’ve underscored early the need to move towards;
Greater collaboration between central and local government, and iwi
Robust and sustainable arrangements for the delivery of local infrastructure and specifically of our water supply, wastewater and storm water services
Confidence in the long-term financial sustainability of the local government system, its current and future role and the funding models applying to it
Improved engagement of citizens and communities in our democratic process and 
Investing in resilience to support the way in which towns and cities are able to respond to a very different future.
The role of local government
Local government has a critical role in delivering on these outcomes for all New Zealanders.
I understand that project localism will build that proposition .This is my mind is not merely a matter of decentralisation .Local leadership delivers on well-being .There is an opportunity for new thinking about how a circular economy, social enterprise, procurement, economic development partnerships deliver better outcomes.  This will be a game changer but not because it separates out localism and local solutions but because it reinforces coordination and collaboration.
The scale of our Government’s commitment to a broad agenda of well-being (as referred to by the Minister of Finance) has been reinforced by affirming changes through the Local Government (Community Wellbeing) Act. 
Local government promotes the social, economic, environmental, and cultural well-being of communities and enables democratic local decision-making by and on behalf of communities.
Many of the challenges local communities face depend on local government to meet them: safe drinking water, treating waste water, catchment management, planning and development, local transport, properly functioning property market, waste services, moving to a zero-carbon economy, community leadership, and representation on issues that matter to local communities.
Local government is ideally placed to respond to these challenges. The sector is also poised to be a critical partner in the Government’s wider priorities and it will require us all to have a mature and necessary conversation about how these can be achieved.  
Local communities face other large, complex challenges such as climate change, natural hazards and emergencies, tourism demand, migration, and demand for changing land use.
However, councils vary widely in area, population, infrastructure assets, community needs, rating base, and financial resources. I’m encouraged by the way Councils are determined to respond to these challenges as you seek to tailor solutions to meet local needs and circumstances. For greater coherence in this response, strategic leadership through collaboration and partnership with central government can achieve better outcomes and an effective system of local
