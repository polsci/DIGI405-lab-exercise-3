Acknowledgements
E’etai ia le paia maualuga ua afifio ma papa aao nei, le paia le popo, ma le mamalu ua o’o, aua Samoa ma Tagata o le Pasefika ua aofaga potopoto.
I thank the Chair & Trustees of the Pacific Music Awards for all your work and for the invitation to speak tonight.
I acknowledge the presence of our beautiful and gifted artists & nominees. 
I thank also my parliamentary colleagues, Hon. Minister Carmel Sepuloni.
I lau Afioga Faolotoi Reupena Pogi, Consul-General of Samoa, Mrs Rosie Blake, the Cook Islands Consul General. 
Our church leaders, our traditional leaders, our chiefs and orators.
And to our generous sponsors whose loyalty and commitment has sustained these awards for so many years now. Ladies & gentlemen, families, friends and supporters. Warm Pacific Greetings.
My elders have often said, E le falala fua laau o le vao. The trees of the forest do not move without reason. 
E mafua ona falala, ona ua agi le matagi. They move because the winds have begun to blow. 
Tonight, I feel the winds of change in the air. We’re all here to celebrate and acknowledge your artistic successes, there is no doubt.
But it’s also a time to reflect on our past, and to gain inspiration from it, as we look to the future.
 
Pacific Music Awards
The Pacific Music Awards was set up to realise a vision for the celebration of Pacific music.  We’re realizing that vision here tonight.
It’s now an iconic event — a highlight of the New Zealand music industry calendar.  I never once doubted that it would be.  Our people are just naturally gifted when it comes to music and the arts. 
I recall back in 2005 when Rev Mua, Sina and Petrina came to seek help from the former Manukau City Council to sponsor and support a new initiative called the Pacific Music Awards. 
I didn’t need to be convinced about supporting it. We just had to work out how we could get the funding from Manukau City Council and to keep the Pacific Music Awards in the Southside.
Well we did it, and it’s probably one of the best investment the Manukau City Council ever made. The Awards moved here in 2006, and I’m so pleased that we continue to celebrate it in Southside Auckland.
There are so many people who shared our vision back then, and laid the foundations for this magnificent achievement. 
They include the Trustees of the Pacific Music Awards, the many wonderful public, private & industry sponsors, and all of you, the musicians, your families and the wider Pacific community, here in Aotearoa New Zealand, and throughout the Pacific region.
 
PMA’s success
I knew then, the Pacific Music Awards would someday become a recognised iconic feature of the international music scene.
I believed it then, and I believe it now.
Every year since 2005, the line-up of fantastic Pasifika talent has continued to grow and grow.
