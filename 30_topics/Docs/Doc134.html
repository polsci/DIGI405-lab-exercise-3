I want to begin by setting the scene and giving a bit of context to the situation in which the New Zealand economy is operating right now.

Given that we’re at Sky City, it feels fitting to start by referencing the recent comments by Sky City Chair Rob Campbell, who said that New Zealand “is a great place to open and operate a business.”

As you all know we are country with strong institutions, legislation and regulation to ensure fairness and ease of doing business. Our banking system is sound, we continue to sit near or at the top of Transparency International ratings for the absence of corruption.

The fundamentals of the New Zealand economy are strong. We are in surplus – projected to be $3.1 billion this year, rising to $7.3 billion by 2021/22. Net core Crown debt is low compared to international trends, and our Government is committed to reducing that to 20% of GDP over the next five years. Over the forecast period we are set to see GDP growth average around 3%.

In terms of current indicators there are also good signs:

Our terms of trade are near a record high
	Our stock market is up around its record high
	Building consents in the June quarter were up 7.5%, pointing to robust residential investment in new housing
	Business investment was up 5.5% in the latest GDP data.
This has led to solid employment growth, with 94,000 more people employed in the year to the end of June. Unemployment sits at 4.5%, with projections of it heading towards 4% over the next few years.

Last week’s employment statistics also showed the highest employment rates ever for Maori and women, and we’ve seen a fall in the number of young people not in employment, education or training.

Last week’s ANZ Job Ads series was up 4.7% in July from a year ago.

And we are seeing wages start to rise as working Kiwis share more in the benefits of economic growth.

That is where we are now.

That is not to say that everything is perfect or there are not challenges and risks that we must face up to.

In the last few months I’ve had conversations with business leaders up and down the country. I’ve consistently heard similar messages: that businesses are optimistic about their own prospects, but that they do have some concerns. They face problems finding workers with the right skills. They are also concerned about growing trade protectionism and geopolitical tensions abroad. And yes, there are aspects of the Government’s agenda that they disagree with.

In KPMG’s 2018 New Zealand CEO Outlook Survey, released this week, CEOs are optimistic about the economic environment in New Zealand, but their number one concern is geopolitical volatility.

That concern about the international picture is something I share and which the Government will continue to monitor. It is important not to overdramatise the situation. Global growth is projected to be 3.9% this year. But there are issues well beyond New Zealand’s control that we need to be mindful of. Tit-for-tat tariff restrictions, some slowdown in the Chinese economy and various international tensions are risks that, if they develop further, will affect New Ze...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in
