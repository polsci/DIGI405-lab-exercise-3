Introduction/Acknowledgements 
Good Morning. Thank you, Tenby. It’s a real privilege to be speaking to you today as the Minister for Small Business. 
I would like to thank the organisers and sponsors of this Summit, and all of those here today, for taking the opportunity to be present at this event. 
Our Government is committed to building a strong economy, so I would like to talk today about the role of SMEs in our wider economy. I also want to talk about my aspirations for the sector. 
But for me, the real value for this summit is your ideas on what government can do to drive support and optimise the potential of the SME sector in New Zealand.  So while I am here to speak, it’s more important that I listen.
New Zealand on the International Stage 
New Zealand performs well against a number of international measures. The World Bank consistently ranks us near the top of its ‘Ease of Doing Business’ rankings – and in this year’s report we ranked first out of 190 economies.  They gave us the top spot for starting a business, registering property and getting credit. 
The OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) ranked New Zealand first for control of corruption, fifth for rule of law and fourth for government effectiveness.  So our public services and public policy rate really well, and our public sector is seen as independent.
The OECD also measures well-being beyond GDP.  We performed well in their Better Life Index, ranking at the top in health status and third in community.  But we’re not doing well enough for housing, income and work-life balance – something every small business owner will understand
International rankings like these show that New Zealand performs well compared to others; but, as a country with nearly half a million small businesses, and very few large businesses, it is vital that we keep making improvements. 
We are fortunate to be a country that is an attractive place to visit and live; however, we need to think about reshaping the economy to deliver improved well-being and ensure the benefits are spread fairly across society. 
Our Government is focussed on improving the wellbeing and living standards of all New Zealanders through productive, sustainable and inclusive growth for a strong low-carbon economy. 
What this means is that we want to ensure our businesses are prosperous, but also safeguard the future prosperity of our children. 
This Government will support businesses both small and big, that produce goods and services, provide decent jobs for New Zealanders, and export. 
We usually think of exporters as big companies – but if you look at businesses with 6-19 employees, almost a quarter export, and market access is crucial for improving theirs and New Zealand’s export performance.
Overseas markets provide access to more buyers, to new technologies and to new sources of capital. Exporting helps businesses harness economies of scale.  It builds a strong incentive to innovate, and improves productivity as a result. It also exposes businesses to greater competition – which can be tough – but it forces us to sharpen up our own business practices. Trade helps us create a greater number of sustainable jobs in New Zealand with higher wages.
But the government needs to make sure that we live, and enhance, the brand we take to the world.  This clean, green 100 per cent pure marketing slogan that has somehow morphed into our global brand is the one thing we have that can’t be copied in low-wage economies.  And we devalue it at our peril.  
SME overview 
SMEs have a distinct role to play in our economy. They provide opportunities for entrepreneurship, productivity and employment. And they are sources of innovation. 
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. From the plumber in New Plymouth to the next high-tech start-up in Hamilton, or Peter Beck and Rocket Lab in my electorate – not that he’s exactly a small business anymore - you provide the jobs that keep New Zealand growing. We need to ensure that growth in this sector is maximised.
There are many social benefits to having a strong SME sector. Most businesses in the provinces are small.  They play a crucial rule in their local economies, and help to build diverse communities. 
Small businesses employ almost a third of our workers, and contribute over a quarter of our GDP. 
They play a crucial role in our country’s and our regions’ economic success. For example, 42 per cent of all jobs created in 2015 were in the SME sector. 
They account for over 97 per cent of all businesses in New Zealand; 96 per cent here in Auckland. 
In a fast-paced world, with ever-changing technology and ways of working, having innovative and nimble small businesses, run by engaged individuals, is more important than ever. 
We live in one of the most diverse nations in the world, and we benefit from diversity on many levels. It brings broader perspectives, connections and networks that generate innovation and lead to increased productivity – which can only be good for business. 
It is important to prepare and support SMEs to be flexible, adaptable and technically skilled for a world that is increasingly digital, global and specialized.
72 per cent of small businesses have internet sales, and with the continued roll out of ultra-fast broadband more and more small businesses will ‘go digital’, embrace e-commerce and be able to get their products and services into the best-paying markets. 
The world is changing and large multi-nationals like Ali Baba and Amazon are driving consumer behaviour like never before. We need to be on top of these changes, if we are to take advantage of them.
Government initiatives available to small businesses 
Since taking on this portfolio, one thing I’ve learned is that far too many small business owners don’t know about the wide range of services and assistance available to them to help grow their businesses.  Disseminating information is a key challenge.
Can I ask you to put up your hand - who here pays provisional tax? Who here likes this regime? Have any of you heard of AIM – or Accounting Income Method?
AIM is a new way to manage provisional tax, using accounting software. It’s been developed in response to small business’ feedback that they want a way to manage provisional tax in line with how their business operates. AIM is available as an option from 1 April and you will need to opt in, through your AIM capable accounting software, on or before the first AIM payment due date which, for most, who file GST two monthly, will be the 28th of June. 
There’s no need to apply or register for AIM.  You just opt in by sending your first AIM statement when you software prompts you – at the same time as the software is working out your GST.  If you decide not to use AIM in the 2018-19 year, you’ll have another chance to opt in the following year. Businesses must choose to use AIM for the full tax year, but new businesses can start using AIM when they start trading.
