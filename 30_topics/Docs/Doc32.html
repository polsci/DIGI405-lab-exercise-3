I want to use this opportunity to speak really frankly with you at the beginning of our term in Government.
If we are speaking frankly I should really name the elephant in the room, and that is the business confidence surveys.
Oh I’ve seen them. I’ve seen them. In a way they feel akin almost to being in high school and suddenly discovering the notes people are passing around the class about you.
I know that it’s a reflection of the perception that exists about primarily the change in Government.
There is some hope that, particularly in the fact that confidence as it relates to businesses’  individual activities is still high, and given that’s the marker that bares the most correlation to GDP growth, then I feel we have at least some cause to feel confident in those numbers.
We’re probably okay. But I’m not satisfied with that. I want perception to meet reality.
What is the current reality that we face?
Well, growth is sitting around 3 percent and is forecast to sit around 2.9 percent.
Unemployment is forecast to drop to an incredibly low 4 percent.
Debt is tracking down - we are sitting in the early 20s and tracking to hit 20 percent.
So the forecast is good. But business is still carrying an umbrella with them.
Now I could just sit back and say that is the way it is. I am of course in good company, the same thing happened to the last Labour Government. It was a continuous issue with the last Labour Government despite having the strongest continuous economic growth since World War II.
Now I could either accept that that’s just what happens to Labour, or we can try to find a way to challenge it. 
The reason ultimately I want to find a way to challenge it is it says to me we are not making the most of our relationships. That we are co-existing in spite of each other, and not collaborating in areas where we could make a genuine difference together.
That’s the primary reason -  it’s not simply my ego - that’s why I would like to see those numbers come into alignment.
I accept that there is a reason why the numbers are the way they are. 
Business confidence is really a measure of the level of certainty that business feels. 
We have come through very uncertain times.
I was reflecting that, 12 months ago I was still a list MP in central Auckland; we hadn’t even had a Mount Albert by-election; I wasn’t Deputy Leader, let alone Leader of the Labour Party; and we certainly weren’t looking at this particular final outcome.
So I understand that in 12 months, we have had a lot of rapid change.
And that means there is a level of uncertainty, which is why I am very eager to make the most of opportunities, like this, to share very openly what our plans and priorities are as a Government. 
But not just what we want to do - how we want to do it. Because the way we would like to operate as a Government is open, transparent and collaborative, particularly with the business community.
So I want to take this opportunity to share some of our priorities, primarily as they relate to the economy and, as we have talked about many times before, how we want to transform our economy. 
There is a whole separate speech I could give about our social agenda. I’ll touch on points of it, but I’ll primarily focus on this side of the ledger.
Our first priority is to both generate and share prosperity. Probably there is an assumption that we don’t put enough emphasis on the ‘generate’ element of the ledger, so I want to speak to that a little bit first.
You might remember that Grant Robertson, not too long ago, led a significant piece of work called The Future of Work. It was an opportunity for us to bring together business and unions - employees - and it nutted out the challenges we face as a country as our work environment transforms.
We know that over 40 percent of jobs that exist now will not exist in a few decades as they’re either replaced or disappear entirely.
In that transformational environment we can either approach that with fear or we can tackle it by making sure we are prepared with an utterly prepared workforce.
We can’t predict where the future will take us but we can prepare our people for it. Helpfully some of what came out of that work is the other challenge we face - our productivity challenge.
Of course we’ve had this raised with us before by the OECD and the IMF and they’ve pointed frequently to New Zealand needing to address that challenge, primarily through the same thing that will make sure we’re prepared for the future, and that’s education and training.
When I attended the last APEC round table in Da Nang we had a chance to meet with senior leaders from the IMF and talked through with them some of our plans around training and education. They were heartened that we were finally taking on what they saw as our major productivity challenge. 
What does that look like? 
I like to characterise it as a goal that we have as a Government for everyone to be earning, learning, caring or volunteering, so that everyone in our communities has a role that is both valued and actually deals with questions of social isolation. It’s a double whammy.
If everyone has a role in earning, learning, caring or volunteering you can also make an assumption that they’re engaged in society and contributing, and feeling valued in some way.
The ‘earning, learning’ areas are where we have put a great amount of emphasis in our first 100 days. 
Many of you will be familiar with our investment in the principle of the first year fees free. 
There’s been a lot of talk about the focus on someone who's going into tertiary education for the first time - going to university - having the first year free. 
It might surprise you to learn that the eligibility actually means that the vast majority of people who could take that first year up are those who’ve never studied before, but not the ones who’ve come straight out of secondary school. 
It’s the people who need to retrain, who might be in precarious work or work that may disappear, who represent the majority of those eligible for fees free.
Secondly the vast majority is likely to be taken up by students and trainees in polytechs, wananga, vocational training and apprenticeships - exactly where we need people to be.
When people say ‘why didn’t you invest in the third year, not the first year?’ they’re taking a very university-centric approach. What we’re trying to do is make sure that we’re upskilling in those areas where we have a major skill shortage. I hope they will be working in the areas of business where you need them to.
But addressing that challenge is not just about making education and further training accessible - and there’s a lot of work I know business is doing in those areas too. It's also about what we are doing in research and development, and innovation. 
I often reflect on the amazing talks that Paul Callaghan used to give, the way he was able to capture the real psyche of New Zealand as not the largest, not always the one that will dominate for instance the area of health innovation,  but as a place that could be the best in the world at sleep apnea equipment.
It's the ability to find that little niche. And if we find that niche a hundred times over, we suddenly become an economy that starts lifting its wages and its sights about where its future might be. 
We do have the ability to be not the biggest, but the smartest. That means though not just the education part of the picture, but what we do around R & D. 
Megan Woods, Minister for Science, Research and Technology, is reviewing that environment because at the moment our contribution to R & D as a percentage of GDP is 1.3%. It’s half of what the OECD level is.
Our goal - and actually this was something that was brought to the table by New Zealand First during coalition talks – was to lift that to 2 percent in a period of 10 years.
So the next step is what we do to incentivise private investment in R & D alongside Crown investment. 
I have no doubt that we have the smarts; I have no doubt that actually we have the regulatory environment. There is a reason that Peter Beck is launching from Mahia, and it is not just the beautiful scenery or the fact that the biggest disruption is a little fishing boat running across the water. There is an environment here that we should capitalise on and that is based on our size, but we do need to make sure that we are investing in research an...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (%
