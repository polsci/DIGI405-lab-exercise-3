The previous presenters today have touched on a range of ideas for how we can face the challenge of improving our productivity in a changing world. From technology and data to public services and the energy transition, I’m excited to see forward thinking people working on such a broad range of important topics. I’d like to commend you all and encourage you to keep up the good work.
My presentation today will focus on an issue that is at the heart of a productive economy, how we approach the rapidly changing world of work.  I want to talk about how this fits with the overall economic strategy of the Government, the core policy areas that we have identified to support New Zealanders in this process and the institutional settings required to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of the Future of Work.
Economic Strategy
By harnessing the potential of new technology and innovation, educating and upskilling our workforce, and incentivising research and development, we can lift productivity and transition to an economy that is sustainable, inclusive, and productive. That is this Government’s overarching economic aim.
The lessons learned from the Future of Work Commission heavily influenced this Government’s economic strategy. We aim to shape an economy where we work smarter, make better use of our resources, ensure everyone who wants to work can work, and ensure that the benefits of growth are spread across society.
In an article published this past weekend, Rod Oram argued that: “we can rise to the immense challenge of making this a high value, high wage economy over the next decade. The global and local conditions for doing so are the most favourable ever.” 
I know there is an appetite among businesses and workers to take up this challenge, and I couldn’t agree more that the time is right to face up to this.
Boosting productivity across the economy will be one of the key drivers to improving New Zealanders’ living standards and wellbeing. The Government will put this at the heart of what we do.
Our focus on lifting wellbeing will require a different approach and different measures of success. We want to take a broader view of success and move beyond simple measures such as GDP, which, while an important measure of economic output, does not tell the full story of peoples’ wellbeing. 
We are working with our Confidence and Supply partner, the Green Party, on new sustainable development indicators, to paint a fuller picture of how well off people are and how the Government can focus its resources best. 
I have also instructed the Treasury to accelerate their work on the Living Standards Framework, which measures the impact of policies on four capitals: Human, Social, Natural, and Financial/Physical.
I intend to use this framework to inform the Budget process for Budget 2019, making it our first ever Wellbeing Budget. By placing wellbeing at the heart of what we do, we will be able to measure the extent to which our policies and investments are making real improvements to peoples’ lives.
Improving productivity is key to improving wellbeing. By producing more from every hour worked, businesses become more profitable, incomes rise, and workers’ wellbeing rises as time is freed up and purchasing power rises. The challenge is, how we achieve this?
The Changing World of Work
This Government has come into office at an interesting time in New Zealand’s economic story. Technological advances are transforming our world, for example through increased processing power and big data, sensors, remote work, or smart devices. 
The full effect of forces such as automation, algorithms, and globalisation are not yet known, but we do know that they already are, and will continue to be, disruptive to what only 5 or 10 years ago we considered the status quo. 
My thinking on this topic was shaped by the Future of Work Commission which I chaired for the Labour Party when we were in Opposition.  It was an ambitious undertaking that saw us engage with thousands of New Zealanders and experts from around the world. It is hard to distil that work down to a few points, but overall, my takeaway is that there is an enormous possibility for us to have productive and fulfilling work over the coming decades. But it will only happen if we prepare ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic)
