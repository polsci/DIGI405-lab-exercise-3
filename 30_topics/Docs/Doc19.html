I have noted all of your names and will instruct my staff that you simply must each have a one-on-one meeting with the new Minister before Christmas.
In seriousness, can I acknowledge the important and valuable work of the Foundation supporting legal research and scholarship.
The breadth of your work is truly impressive. This year alone we’ve seen publications ranging from a guide to the law for youth and adolescents; a treatise on the role of the Sovereign, Governor-General and Crown; feminist judgments in New Zealand; and reports ranging from ethics and policy in the genomic era; the pace of civil High Court cases; and environmental protections enforcement.
I have enjoyed attending Law Foundation annual dinners in the past, but I am particularly pleased to be here this year in a new capacity as Minister of Justice and Minister for Courts. Can I acknowledge the Memorandum of Understanding between the Foundation and the Ministry of Justice, which is mutually beneficial.
It is a privilege to be called upon tonight to announce the winner of this year’s Cleary Memorial Prize for the young lawyer who shows the most promise to the profession. I am looking forward to that task!
For politicians who speak at this annual event, it’s an opportunity to talk about the state of things in our legal system; although I have a vivid memory of Hon Christopher Finlayson QC last year using his speaking opportunity to give an excoriating review of Rt Hon Sir Geoffrey Palmer’s and Andrew Butler’s recent call for a written constitution.
I have no intention of engaging in that important debate tonight. I am firmly in the camp of those who believe a written constitution is vital in the 21st century, not the least for reasons of wider public access and understanding.
But it is, after all, the 150th anniversary of the publication of Walter Bagehot’s exposition of The English Constitution which, amongst other things, celebrated its unwritten nature. I suspect that was more about the fact its true nature could be hidden from the people rather than lofty notions of incremental adaptability.
Bagehot was no democrat; he was, for example, opposed to extending the franchise. And he saw the real essence of government lying with the Cabinet.
He described Cabinet as “the efficient secret of the English Constitution”. It was “the close union, the nearly complete fusion, of the executive and legislative powers.”
In his time-honoured phrase, Cabinet was “the hyphen that joins, the buckle that fastens.”
I don’t know what Bagehot would make of the genuine MMP government we have now – not much, I suspect, as he was deeply opposed to anything that looked like popular support.
An MMP government made up of parties of substance (as opposed to one large party supported by a couple of one-man bands) calls for a different way of operating, both in the Executive and in Parliament.
Parties matter in MMP government. This is good. This is the check and balance I think voters were looking for in 1993 when we opted for the new electoral system.
I believe there is more we can do to make our constitutional arrangements accessible to more citizens, but I can report the government has no specific proposals at this stage, and I will dwell on it no further.
But we definitely have some critical questions to face in the justice sector, some of which may have constitutional implications.
There are three major challenges confronting me as Minister of Justice as I start in this role: firstly, improving access to justice; secondly, a criminal justice system that is growing its prison population faster than we’ve ever known; and, thirdly, reaffirming, more by actions than legislating for it, the paramountcy of the rule of law. 
Let me deal briefly with each of those challenges.
On access to justice, like many in the sector I have become increasingly concerned that a gap is opening up between those who have the means to enforce or defend their legal rights and those who don’t.
In the criminal justice sector, we already provide (at least to some) legal aid or access to a publicly-funded defence lawyer. In the civil arena we have developed, over many years, various low level and low cost (to the user) tribunals to deal with particular types of legal claims (the Disputes Tribunal, Motor Vehicle Disputes Tribunal, Real Estate Agents Tribunal, Tenancy Tribunal, Customs Appeal Authority, Student Allowance Appeal Authority, ACC appeals and r...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words
