I want to start by discussing the rationale behind our first Wellbeing Budget and focus on two initiatives in my portfolio areas that I hope will be of interest to you. 
While economic growth is of course important – and we will continue to pursue it and measure it – it does not in itself guarantee improving living standards.
Our Wellbeing Budget takes a different approach than has been traditional, and it is one the OECD is watching quite closely. That was reinforced to me during my trip to the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris last week. 
We are trying to take a more integrated approach to thorny issues which have been problematic for decades and in some case are still getting worse.
New Zealand has seen solid rates of GDP growth relative to our peers but what about the quality of that economic activity and how it has been shared?
None of us want to live in a country where, despite a strong economy, families are homeless, our environment is being degraded, our water quality is poor, and where people with mental health issues do not receive the support they need, and where we have shocking levels of teen suicide, family violence and child poverty.
Yet despite a widespread view that current methods of organising government priorities have not overcome these challenges, there has not been a fundamental change to how we organise budget priorities since the 1980s.
Budget processes have remained the same, cost benefit analysis is often short term. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised then that many of these long term difficult problems are unresolved, with siloed initiatives biased towards the status quo. 
Approach to Wellbeing Budget
The Wellbeing Budget delivered yesterday has five priorities, which were developed using the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework, evidence from sector-based experts and the Government’s Science Advisors, and through collaboration among public sector agencies and Ministers. 
These priorities, which – obviously – must always include - include prospects for improvement of our economy, but need to go beyond that. We identified the areas where we believe we can make the biggest difference to New Zealanders’ wellbeing.
 They are:
Transforming the Economy: Creating opportunities for productive businesses, regions, iwi and others to transition to a sustainable and low-emissions economy;
Building a Productive Nation: Supporting a thriving nation in the digital age through innovation, social and economic opportunities;
Improving Child Wellbeing: Reducing child poverty and improving child wellbeing, including addressing family violence;
Taking Mental Health Seriously: Supporting mental wellbeing for all New Zealanders, with a special focus on under 24-year-olds; and
Supporting Maori and Pasifika Aspirations: Lifting Māori and Pacific incomes, skills and opportunities. 
The Budget bids from ministers were then addressed, by asking three big questions:
was the bid intergenerational, and will it make a difference now and for the lives of our children, grandchildren and beyond? 
does it move us beyond narrow measures of success to take into consideration a wider set of factors?
does it take a whole of government approach? 
If you have delved into the Budget and followed the announcement we have made over the past 22 hours you will have seen how we put that approach into practice.
Mental health and family violence initiatives have rightly received the most attention.
But today I want to focus on two policies which sit within the first two of those five priorities; Creating opportunities for productive businesses, regions, iwi and others to transition to a sustainable and low-emissions economy; and supporting a thriving nation in the digital age through innovation, social and economic opportunities.
The first I will cover is our plan to Deepen our Early Stage Capital Markets
Let me start by putting this in an economic context. 
We know that lifting productivity is crucial. New Zealand’s productivity problems have been well canvassed. 
Both diffusion of technology and the development of innovative new products and services are inhibited by low per capita investment in our productive businesses.
Finding ways to address this is a key part of our work programme. Recent initiatives like the R and D tax credit, ring fencing of losses and extending the brightline test are intended to weight investment towards the productive sectors, and to lift economic performance. In some ways it’s simple. We want to grow our productive sectors and reduce speculative investment. 
To do this we need to apply more financial capital and more people to the task, and as the saying goes people will follow the money.
The world is in the midst of a technological revolution born of the confluence of affordable computer power, mobile positioning systems, sensors, robotics, big data and the internet of things, artificial intelligence and genetics. 
We all know the digitalisation of many parts of the economy create challenges we are dealing with under the banner of the future of work. The flip side of that challenge is the enormous opportunity to improve the efficiency of existing methods of production or to commercialise the new products and services born of this revolution.
New Zealand needs to chase down as many of these commercial opportunities as we can and harness the jobs and the value.
There is another factor at play. The Productivity Commission recently noted the dichotomy we face in this digital world. Many of these new niches are narrow but have global potential. The same technology which enables innovation in New Zealand without large institutional form, also enables that technology to be applied globally. These global characteristics, which makes them very valuable, and the journey to scale and dominate the niches is costly.
