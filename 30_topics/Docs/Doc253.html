Thank you, Roger Beaumont, for your introduction.
Can I take a moment to thank you all for coming out this morning for this launch of the New Zealand Bankers Association’s Guidelines to help banks meet the needs of older and disabled customers. 
I would like to welcome to members of the Disabled Peoples Organisations, including Blind Citizens, People First, Deaf Aotearoa and the DPA, as well as Disability Service Providers who are here- IHC, the Blind Foundation and CCS Disability Action, and those of you here from Dementia NZ and Grey Power. I know you have all given your time and energy to the development of these new guidelines and I thank you for being a part of this.

I understand that many of you here today are members of the Code of Banking Practice Focus Group for Older and Disabled People. I’m pleased to hear that you have had the opportunity to be involved in the development of these guidelines and have been able to engage directly with the banks to ensure we are putting into place best practice.

When these guidelines become mandatory in 2020, they will help to ensure that the banking system is more inclusive and is accessible for older and disabled customers. 
Not only are the guidelines the right thing to do they are also good for business. 
These guidelines align well with this Governments focus on a more accessible Aotearoa. Last year we agreed to a major accessibility work programme, which commits us to exploring how we can achieve full accessibility for disabled people and all New Zealanders. These guidelines are an excellent example of making accessibility of services a reality.
These guidelines are also important in helping mitigate potential abuse that can occur for disabled people and older people. One in ten people over 65 will be subject to some form of elder abuse – with over 50% of this being financial abuse. This is most often at the hands of a family member or a trusted person, like a carer. I know this is a concern also reflected in the disability community. Being able to have the independence to access services themselves is an important step to a...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic)
