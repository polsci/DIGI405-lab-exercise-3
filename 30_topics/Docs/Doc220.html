[CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY]
Kia ora tatou.
Thank you for the invitation to be here. It is a great privilege to be welcomed to Ratana again.
Let me acknowledge the leadership of Tumuaki Harerangi Meihana, those of you who have already addressed the Government from the Taumata, and the presence of all of the members of the Ratana Church.
Also let us acknowledge the attendance of Government parties, the Green Party, Labour, and New Zealand First all here today on a united front.
 On behalf of the Government, let me extend the apologies of the Prime Minister who could not attend today because of her work commitments which means she is currently travelling overseas.
This year we mark one hundred and one years since Wiremu Ratana started his spiritual journey which has become the Ratana movement as we know it today.

When the government stood before you all last year we promised a Government with a difference.
  A government which looked after people.  A government which addressed neglect and social inequality. A government which grows the economy and is getting people back into work.
But as the old saying goes – words are not deeds. One year on, this government has put deeds to its words.

Doctors’ visits also became cheaper for those with Community Services Cards, and more money has been invested into hospitals. We are opening more housing opportunities through Kiwibuild homes.  And we are heavily investing in the economic development of our regions through the provincial growth fund
