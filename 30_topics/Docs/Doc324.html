Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa.  Good afternoon.
It’s great to see you all here, marking 30 years since the Public Finance Act came into law.  
If you’ll step into the Tardis with me for a brief moment, I’d like to take us back to 1989, to set the scene, and remind us all how far we’ve come.  
The fourth Labour Government was in power. It was the year that Dennis Conner walked out on the interview on the Holmes show, Sunday trading came into effect in time for the Christmas rush, TV3 began broadcasting, and the crew of the Rose-Noelle were found alive after 119 days missing at sea.  
Supermarkets started selling wine – but not beer.  (That didn’t happen until ten years later, in 1999.)   And I was in my final year at high school.
We were listening – and dancing – to Moana Jackson, When the Cat’s Away, the Warratahs, the Straitjacket Fits, the Front Lawn and Upper Hutt Posse.  
Shane van Gisbergen – one of our fastest New Zealanders on four wheels – was born in 1989, as was the Student Army’s Sam Johnson, and our population was less than three and a half million (3.37 million people, to be more precise). 
But amidst all this, it was a time when the government and the public service were struggling with entrenched issues related to fiscal sustainability – high levels of debt, poor transparency, and poor responsiveness to Ministers.  It was a time of focussing on inputs, not outcomes, and – it sounds incredible today – it was all based on a cash accounting system. 
It was difficult to measure agencies’ performance and to get an accurate and up-to-date picture of what was being spent, and where wastage was happening.
In July 1989 though, something happened that began to change all of that.
Peter Neilson, who was the Associate Minister of Finance, introduced the Public Finance Bill to Parliament.  I was amused to read in Professor Ian Ball’s recollection of Peter’s speech, that Peter started off by saying that “We all know accounting is boring; public sector accounting is boring to the power of two”, before going on to introduce what – with the hindsight of today – became a revolution in New Zealand’s public finance system.
Since the PFA took effect in 1989, our public finance system has taken control of its fiscal position, has high levels of transparency and accountability; and is renowned internationally.  
It did that by putting a model in place that focussed on management, outputs and performance, and was based on decentralisation, accountability and much greater transparency.  The Fiscal Responsibility Act, which followed on the heels of the PFA and was later incorporated into it, created a framework for robust fiscal management. 
We can easily point to some enduring and positive outcomes from our public finance legislation.  Now: -
Our public finances are strong.  New Zealand’s public debt is relatively low compared to our international peers, and the government is running operating surpluses which are forecast to increase further
New Zealand ranks relatively close to the top of many international transparency, corruption and wellbeing indicators, and we have a high level of trust in government
We are consistently ranked no.1 in global surveys of ease of doing business and starting a business. 
In contrast, many OECD countries are still grappling with fundamental macro, fiscal, and public trust challenges. 
And maybe we can see that public sector accounting isn’t “boring to the power of two” any longer – that increased transparency has also brought about an increased – and welcome – level of scrutiny of public sector spending, and the outcomes it achieves; and increased public interest in what the government is delivering using the revenues that it collects.
The foundations laid down in the Public Finance Act 30 years ago still provide a platform for us to think about the range of outcomes that matter to the wellbeing of New Zealanders, and how these inform what the public sector does and how it operates.  
Our strong fiscal position provides the space for us to be ambitious about what we can do to improve people's living standards.  
But the PFA and the public finance system has limitations that undermine the Government’s pursuit of wellbeing objectives, and I hope the architects here today will take this in the right spirit.  The system doesn’t always give us the support we need to fulfil our vision for New Zealand.  We need to maintain the strengths of the current system, while recognising that there are significant improvements we can make.   
The system struggles to deal with complex issues and longer-term opportunities and risks.  And while the original intent of the reforms may well have been to bring about greater flexibility, the way they have been operationalised has sometimes had the effect of putting an “electric fence” around parts of the fiscal management system.  
This can hinder co-operation and innovation, create silos, and make it harder to help people who have needs or problems that fall across agencies. 
Let me expand on that a little more:
The annual budget cycle based around fixed nominal baselines and annual allowances can encourage short-term thinking, and defer longer-term planning and capability building. It also means that most analytical effort is concentrated on the marginal increase in funding, rather than the effectiveness of total government spending
The settings around annual appropriations can be rigid and too tightly controlled, making it unnecessarily difficult to adapt to changing circumstances
The performance accountability conventions we have for estimates, annual reporting and many of our strategic planning requirements have driven a focus on compliance and an aversion to risk – becoming a barrier to innovation.
While – in principle – we have a high level of transparency, the overall story can be harder to see, being buried in detail that is difficult to absorb.  
We can achieve much more. 
My objective is a public finance system that enables the public service to positively assist and improve the intergenerational wellbeing of New Zealanders. 
We need a system where our time and effort is focussed more on ‘strategic’ management of public finances – with a clear ‘line of sight’ to the strategic value of public spending.  We believe that the public finance system can be shifted to improve intergenerational wellbeing on a number of fronts. 
These include: 
Supporting the parts of the system to work better together
Smarter regulation of the system
Lifting performance
Building capability
Strengthening long-term resilience. 
With these improvements in mind, the Government is taking steps to reform the public finance system to reduce risk aversion, promote innovation, and support a more rapid response from the public sector to issues and challenges. 
Our modernisation of the public finance system, addressing its current limitations, is a key element of aligning the public sector to a wellbeing approach.
The work programme includes three important themes – they are:
Firstly, changing the overarching framework for measuring success and identifying the priorities, through amendments to embed wellbeing in the Public Finance Act, as well as the government's broader commitment to sustainable development goals
Secondly, changing the financial management framework, to increase flexibility, encourage collaboration and support and enable a more strategic focus.  This includes changes to the appropriation system and a different approach to planning and reporting
And thirdly, rethinking the approach to the Budget, so that we look at existing as well as new spending, and create more space to focus on the challenges and trade-offs needed to improve wellbeing for all New Zealanders.
The wellbeing of our citizens is at the heart of everything we do, both now and for the future.  We need new thinking to achieve this vision.  
Rather than measuring progress in purely economic terms, this Government is committed to using a broader framing to measure New Zealand’s progress, to develop and assess policy and support decision-making.   This includes fiscal policy, where we want to consider the wellbeing of our environment, people and communities, alongside existing macroeconomic and fiscal indicators.
As you will know, this year we produced our first Wellbeing Budget. This is built around Treasury’s Living Standards Framework. We used evidence from the LSF and other expert advice to decide our budget priorities, and we are using the framework to measure our success against a range of indicators of wellbeing.
We are also developing a broader set of measures that go beyond measuring progress in purely economic terms. Statistics New Zealand has developed and released a new set of metrics – Indicators Aotearoa New Zealand (IANZ) as a source of measures for New Zealand’s wellbeing. IANZ will support the government as it meets the new wellbeing requirements under the Public Finance Act, as well as monitoring and reporting against the SDGs.
With that in mind, to ensure that every Government considers the wellbeing of New Zealanders when creating future Budgets, I will soon introduce legislation to amend the Public Finance Act so it includes two key changes: 
The Government will be required to set out how its wellbeing and fiscal objectives will guide its Budget
The Treasury will be required to report on the state of current and future wellbeing in New Zealand, at least every four years. 
These changes recognise that we expect wellbeing monitoring to evolve over time as theory, evidence and data availability develop and improve. 
I believe that these amendments will strike the right balance between requiring an enduring focus on wellbeing, but at the same time retaining sufficient flexibility for improvements and changes over time. 
We have already amended the PFA to require the Minister of Finance to report at each Budget on child wellbeing and child poverty reduction. This legislation, passed by a margin of 119-1 in Parliament, means that at Budget time the Minister of Finance must discuss progress made to reduce child poverty in line with the targets in the Child Poverty Reduction Act, and what measures in the Budget will affect child poverty.
