 Auckland, 1 August 2018 
Tēnā koutou katoa.
The Environmental Defence Society (EDS) has an incredible work programme. Can I thank EDS and its funders, who keep going with really high quality policy work. I find that useful both in a technical sense and a political sense as we all try to drive forward on these environmental issues.
It is a pleasure to be back at the EDS conference. It’s great to see so many familiar faces. I know a good proportion of the room actually, having met many of you often over the years. It is particularly pleasing to be back here with a bit more power to actually make some of the changes that I so believe in.
Economic growth within environmental limits
I am Minister for both the Environment and Economic Development, as well as some other portfolios including trade. I am really pleased to be part of a Government that I know is committed to protecting the environment and taking action on climate change in particular, as we also aim to become a more prosperous and fairer society.
Your Government is clear that economic growth should be within environmental limits. Many of you would have heard me say before that I love the quote of former World Bank economist Herman Daly – ‘The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment, not the reverse’. People may get sick of me saying that, but I am going to continue to say it, until in many years to come I give up on politics, because I think it describes a simple truth.
This is not pure idealism, but there is some idealism in there. The environment should be protected for reasons of idealism, not just for economic reasons; but it is also true that protecting the environment does safeguard our economy.
Nowhere in the world is that clearer than in New Zealand. Our two biggest industries, agriculture and tourism, are built on natural capital. They both rely on natural capital for their very existence – we wouldn’t have those industries otherwise – and they both extract higher value than average because of the quality of our environment. So they need our environmental reputation to obtain higher prices for the goods and services that they produce.
That view is shared across government: Labour holds that view, our coalition partner New Zealand First holds that view, as does our confidence and supply partner, the Greens.
At a personal level, I have never accepted that we have to choose between economic growth and a clean environment. I have always believed that we can have both. I see it as a fundamental part of my role in this Government to integrate better environmental outcomes with a stronger economy and a fairer society. I really believe that we can do that and I have strong views as to how we achieve it.
It happens at a number of levels. At the highest Budget level it happens by changing Budget priorities, and we are doing that through trying to look at our Budget priorities through a living standards framework, which addresses all four capitals. It brings natural capital to the fore as well as social, human and financial capital. That work of course is led by Grant Robertson, our Minister of Finance.
Jacinda Ardern, your Prime Minister, pushed climate change up the political agenda during the last election by calling it her generation’s nuclear free moment. At a portfolio level, I push environmental issues every day in every role that I hold.
I had the privilege of launching Catherine Knight’s recent book Beyond Manapouri: 50 years of environmental politics in New Zealand. In it she describes the history of New Zealand environmental regulation and environmental activism at a civil society level, and one of the things she notes is an early recommendation from the OECD.
Now the OECD provides fantastic advice to New Zealand across a range of environmental, social and economic issues, but they do not always get it right. At the time when the Ministry for the Environment was being formed, the OECD recommended that the holders of environmental portfolios not have economic portfolios. I think that was a mistake, and one we made in New Zealand.
We actually thought that the power of the Ministry for the Environment alone would be enough to get to good environmental outcomes, and that we would pollute the idealism of the Ministry if we had economic ministries tied up with it. I think we got that wrong as a country. I think it is only since we have started to integrate those who hold environmental portfolios with other levers in government that we are going to be able to overcome our challenges.
I had that lesson taught to me when last in government, where Helen Clark tied the Climate Change and Energy portfolios. We made some real progress at that time, including introducing an emissions pricing regime, which would have been impossible to achieve if climate change had been left without economic levers related to energy.
Trade 
In terms of my trade portfolio responsibilities, it is unfair to ask trade agreements to do what international environmental agreements cannot achieve. I do tire at times of the critics of trade agreements who say that they shouldn’t cede regulatory sovereignty, but that they should take regulatory sovereignty by requiring ever more enforcement mechanisms to be imposed upon other countries, so that we can seek better environmental outcomes.
While it is unfair to expect trade agreements to do what the world doesn’t seem to be able to agree in its environmental agreements – which is to have enforceability mechanisms built into those agreements ­– nonetheless in trade your Government, and I carry this responsibility, is out there fighting for the right balance.
We always protect the sovereignty of New Zealand to do whatever is necessary environmentally –whether it is through price-based measures, regulations or taxes – so we never cede that sovereignty. But we also try to include enforcement mechanisms to stop things like subsidies of illegal or unreported fishing on the high seas. We do that. We expect other countries to cede their sovereignty on issues like that. We push hard. We do not get everything we want but we actually do m...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic)
