I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to you at the Museums Aotearoa Conference for the second year in a row.
Can I firstly acknowledge iwi in residence at Te Papa, Rongowhakaata, Courtney Johnston (Museums Aotearoa Chair), Museums Aotearoa Board members, Te Papa for hosting this event, and the many attendees gathered here today.
I’d like to begin with a quote in recognition of Museum Week it is very pertinent to the theme of this conference: Ko Aotearoa Tēnei. It says:
On the surface museums seem to show us who we are but their real mission is to transform. Visiting a great museum you should emerge as a different person, having looked at your society and your place in it, and reconsidered how you will live in it – ideally for the better.
From Northland to Rakiura, New Zealand’s museums, galleries and whare taonga are kaitiaki of our memories, our stories and our precious taonga. They play a crucial role in our self-knowledge and our sense of place.
Accessible and welcoming, these institutions are a place for all New Zealanders to come in out of the cold. They bring us together to engage with the things that define our nation, to experience different world views, and to be inspired to think in new ways.
In Aotearoa we are a very diverse society and becoming more so. Differences of ethnicity, culture, age, circumstances, health and ability all contribute to the rich fabric of our communities.
Many of you will have read, in the Museums Aotearoa Quarterly, Phillipa Tocker’s moving comments about the 15 March terrorist attack. She makes an important point about the role museums and other public institutions can play in fostering understanding across cultural, religious, demographic and political barriers.
The aftermath of the horrifying attack has made it imperative that we all look more closely at ourselves and our values.
Last year I talked about the importance of co-creating knowledge, drawing on the traditions, heritage and expertise of our Māori and Pacific communities.
At the heart of ‘Ko Aotearoa Tēnei’ is the concept of partnership – and recognition of the multi-faceted nature of history and knowledge. No longer should any one authority own and disseminate a single version of history. Rather, the onus is on us all to create a genuine sharing of leadership in knowledge.
The recently opened Te Taiao | Nature exhibition here at Te Papa, which combines science and mātauranga Māori, has shown us again how bringing together scientific and cultural knowledge can create a truly holistic experience.
That’s just one example. Institutions throughout this sector are showing great leadership in working beyond their front doors to reflect many rich and diverse sources of knowledge and tradition.
Core to ‘Ko Aotearoa Tēnei’ is Te Tiriti o Waitangi, our founding document which is central to our identity, who we are and where we are heading. 
This Government is focused on building better Crown-Māori relations. With work across departmental agencies gearing up in the context of Wai 262, we are looking ahead to try to give effect to the principles underpinning Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
We are looking to the past too, with momentum building towards the Tuia 250 commemorations next year. With engagement from iwi, Pākeha and Pacific communities, Tuia 250 will be an important chance to recognise the historic meeting of two peoples.
It will also be a chance to be courageous in looking beyond any sanitised or idealised versions we may have encountered about that time in our history. We need to recognise our history for what it is – warts and all. 
Today, in the spirit of ‘Ko Aotearoa Tēnei’ and acknowledging the theme of the session to follow, I particularly want to talk to you about repatriation. 
Since the repatriation of Rapanui koiwi in early 2018 as one of the first events I attended as Associate Minister of Arts Culture and Heritage I have had a deep interest in repatriation. There is no denying the power and mauri present when a process is undertaken to repair what is broken and replace what is lost. Last year, I also had the pleasure to speak at this conference and attend the repatriation panel which I look forward to sitting in on today.
