Opening
Tēnā koutou katoa. Thank you for the opportunity to be here and speak to you today.
It is an honour to be sharing the stage with such knowledgeable and experienced practitioners. 
Conference theme
I want to make clear, that this Government is deeply committed to strengthening our fisheries management system by improving sustainability and building greater transparency.
In the fisheries space, we need to show that profitability and sustainability are not mutually exclusive, but can go hand in hand.
I truly believe that the only way to achieve meaningful change is by being open to others ideas and views.  No one has all the answers, but sometimes solutions to the issues that matter come from the most unlikely of sources.
The thing is, no matter what your connection to the sea – be it commercial, recreational, customary – or an abiding passion for protecting and enhancing our marine environment – we all want the same thing: abundant seas managed in a sustainable way.
Vision
Today, I want to very briefly outline my vision for a sustainable fisheries management system which supports abundant fisheries, for the benefit and enjoyment of all New Zealanders. 
I welcome questions and will leave plenty of time for these. 
To me, a constructive dialogue is critical to forming a strong foundation for working together on a vision that we can all share.
The Government has set out an ambitious work programme for Fisheries New Zealand. 
We need to make sure that the changes we are making now not only improve things in the short-term, but are future focused and sufficiently resilient to set our fisheries management system well into the medium- and long-term. 
We need a fisheries management system that anticipates the needs of our marine environment, our growing and changing population, and the exponential growth in innovation and technology.  
Innovation 
We need a fisheries management system that meets the needs of all key stakeholders in a way that adds value and accrues benefits.  After all, there is no point in change for changes sake.  If we can’t prove benefits over and above cost, then we have failed to make a robust argument for change.
For me, innovation is key.
But not just innovation in the way we fish; but innovation in the way we communicate with key stakeholders; innovation in the way we market our fish products globally; innovation in the way we empower solution providers to seek answers to the burning issues of the day; and of course innovation in the way we look at the potential economic value of every fish.
One example is the development by Revolution Fibres and Sanford, of anti-wrinkle face-packs made from the collagen fibres found in hoki skins. 
After 10 years in development, this product has recently been launched in the China market and is a remarkable story of turning a low value part of the fish from our largest fishery previously used as pet food, into a high value beauty product.
Innovation can provide new, more productive and - most importantly - more sustainable methods of fishing. Examples such as the Precision Seafood Harvesting tool demonstrate how New Zealand fishers are innovating in ways that embody both guardianship of the marine environment, and good business practice. 
I will be looking to Fisheries New Zealand to work closely in partnership with industry to do things differently.  We need to transition from an organisation that in the past told people why they couldn’t do things, into a Ministry that enables solution provides to share their ideas, test them and implement those that work – and learn from those that didn’t.
Transparency – Digital Monitoring
21st Century technology is providing new ways of demonstrating transparency about how fishing activity occurs, and the decisions that underlie our fisheries management system. 
This is important to Fisheries New Zealand, and for commercial fishers – many of whom would like to be able to better demonstrate that they are operating responsibly.
Digital monitoring is a key mechanism to enable increased transparency. 
This data will improve our knowledge of where and when fishing occurs, what is caught and what is returned to the sea. 
The roll out of the first phase of digital monitoring - electronic catch reporting and position reporting - is underway and is providing near real-time data on all trawl vessels larger than 28 metres. This represents 70 percent of all commercial catch in New Zealand.
Electronic catch reporting and position reporting is to be extended to the rest of the commercial fishing fleet and land-based fishers, with roll-out expected to start in the last quarter of this year. 
Transparency is part of this cultural change.  I have instructed Fish NZ to release all documents that go back to the beginning of this century, of course redacting that which is legally privileged.  But let’s draw a line under past practices, perhaps accept we could have done things better at the time, and move on.
There is a picture, I think used by Greenpeace on twitter as part of a campaign to get people to write to me about a certain issue.  It shows three dead dolphins on a large fishing boat – and I believe is meant to portray modern fishing practise.  Unfortunately it has down the bottom “Copyright Ministry of Fisheries”.  Well Ministry of Fisheries existed between 1995 and 2011 so the picture is at least 8 years old or perhaps 20.  
On-board Cameras
Innovation is also an important driver for the introduction of on-board cameras on commercial fishing vessels - a topic I know you will all be interested in.
On-board cameras will significantly improve the quality of information Fisheries New Zealand gets on commercial fishing. They will increase our ability to confirm commercial catch and bycatch, and protected species interactions.
But I do want to be clear - it is vitally important that we address the policy issues that have led to the perverse situation today where fishers are actually incentivised to dump and discard - to high grade.  So before cameras are placed on boats we need to sort out the current deemed value regime as well as the dumping and discarding rules and regulations.
I am developing a paper to take to Cabinet that starts the process of reforming Fisheries policy and begins the conversation that we must have regarding important policy settings. 
My challenge to you is to participate in this process, alongside other stakeholders who may have what feels like contradictory views. You have an important role to play; you bring expertise that this conversation needs. It is critical that all views, all voices, have a space to speak and an opportunity to be heard.  But perhaps start with the premise that the majority – not all I accept – but the majority of fisher men and women are also conservationists.  ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic)
