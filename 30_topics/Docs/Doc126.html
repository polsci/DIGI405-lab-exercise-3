CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY
Good afternoon.
The role of the Prime Minister has evolved along with our constitution. Core functions of the role remain the same–such as chairing Cabinet and key cabinet committees, appointing and dismissing ministers, and advising the Governor-General to call a general election–but there have been profound changes in the political and policy context in which the Prime Ministership operates.
One aspect of the role has never changed, however, and that is the professional and personal qualities that each individual brings to the Prime Ministership. For good or ill, these are the crucial variables that sort the great from the merely good or from those who prove ill-equipped to meet the challenges of the role.
Created out of convention, Political Scientist Leslie Lipson observed in the late 1940s that, ‘the authority of a prime minister is an attribute common to all and derives from the powers of the office. But it is their personal prestige, the respect they inspire, and the confidence with which they are regarded, these are what the individual themselves contribute.’
There couldn’t be a truer statement about the blending of person and role. While the prime ministership has undergone significant changes in recent decades, with our political system more weighted towards prime ministerial than cabinet government as a result, Lipson’s old verity remains.         
Two areas where changes to the role of prime minister are most pronounced are in the increased direct influence and insatiable demands of the media and in the new processes of co-ordination under a prime minister’s control. 
With the advent of social media and the 24/7 news cycle, reinforced by a phalanx of lobbyists and corporate public relations professionals, there is a sense for any prime minister that they are engaged in a continuous campaign.  
The Prime Minister is at the fulcrum of this new media dynamic and must be disciplined and skillful in responding to the insatiable demands of the media, a media that is itself strapped for the resources, space and time needed to properly perform its role. This has regrettably seen the media’s trajectory descend from its historic role as a Fourth Estate into its current sorry state of purveyors of dumbed down and even fake news. 
Thomas Jefferson, over two centuries ago, said, ‘To the press alone, chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.’ 
It is become harder to sustain that thought as evidenced by the sharp decline in basic political and historical knowledge of our political media. Rather, another Jefferson observation seems more apt: ‘From forty years’ experience of the wretched guess-work of the newspapers of what is not done in the open daylight, and of their falsehood even as to that, I rarely think them worth reading, and almost never worth notice.’
In this wretched circumstance, never has the rhetorical role of the prime ministership demanded as much patience nor required as much effort to navigate the shoals of malice and mendacity to maintain effective leadership of their government’s performance and direction.
Turning to executive backing for the Prime Minister, there now exists a large executive operation, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, to support them in their work. Prime Minister Muldoon’s innovation of the day, the creation of an eight-member advisory group now seems quaint. The exponential growth in Prime Ministerial support began when Geoffrey Palmer established the DPMC in 1989. By the end of 1992, the number had increased to 146 staff. By 2017 there were 249 DPMC s...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(38%)</td><td><a
