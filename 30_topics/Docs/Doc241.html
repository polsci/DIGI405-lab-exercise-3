14 March 2019
 E te Kaiwhakawā Tumuaki, e te Perehitene, e ngā kaiwhakawā o te Kōti Matua, tēna koutou. 
May it please the Court, the Chief Justice, the President, your Honours.
Your Honour, it gives me great pleasure to appear on behalf of the Government on the occasion of your swearing in as Chief Justice of New Zealand and Tokelau. I convey the Government’s warmest congratulations and best wishes to you and your family on this significant achievement.  
This is a rare and auspicious Court sitting. It marks an appointment to a crucial position within our constitutional arrangements: the head of the Supreme Court. As our most senior judge, you are the leader of the judicial branch of government; a constitutional guardian, a senior statesperson.  
Your Honour’s appointment as Chief Justice marks the first such appointment since the Supreme Court was established in 2004.    
You are the 13th Chief Justice of New Zealand, the first being appointed in 1841.  Much has changed since then, both in terms of the extent of the responsibilities of the office you now hold, and the legal, cultural and social context within which those responsibilities are exercised.    
Your Honour is the second woman to assume the role.  Your appointment, and that of your predecessor Chief Justice Elias, is an indicator the ledger is balancing towards gender equality within society.  
In contrast to the first Chief Justice, William Martin, who initially had only himself to manage, your Honour leads a Bench of over 250 judges and associate judges.  
Like your predecessors, you have the responsibility to guard the common law, statutes and conventions that underpin our constitutional settings.  These are complex and at the margins sometimes contentious. They involve fundamental principles of respect for human rights, parliamentary sovereignty, and comity and respect between the branches of government.   
Our system works well. It is uncomplicated by a supreme constitution, an upper house, presidential powers or state legislatures.  We don’t face the difficulties other countries have when changing their written constitutions to meet the needs of the day; for example gun laws in the USA; MPs citizenship in Australia; or limits on campaign spending. Our system is moderated by MMP and by our independent judiciary, which enjoys the respect and confidence of the public.
The considered and gradual evolution of New Zealand’s conventions and constitutional laws – including the place of the Treaty of Waitangi – is greatly influenced by the courts. We have seen, for example, the courts develop judicial declarations of inconsistency, expressing the courts’ opinion that Parliament’s law is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights.  
Following the courts’ consideration of this issue, the Government has decided, in principle, that the Bill of Rights should be amended to expressly authorise judges to make declarations of inconsistency.  We are proposing a process for Parliament to consider such a declaration.  This will facilitate healthy, democratic dialogue, which is an important part of our constitution working as it should – to protect civil liberties while retaining Parliamentary sovereignty.
