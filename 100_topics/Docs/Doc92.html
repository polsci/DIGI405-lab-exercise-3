I would like thank the EMA for the invitation to speak here, and thanks to all of you for coming along today.

This afternoon I’d mainly like to talk to you about this Government’s agenda for partnership with business. We are committed to deepening and strengthening that partnership so that together we can grow our economy to be more productive, more sustainable and more inclusive.

Context - Economic Strategy

The context for that relationship is our economic strategy.

We’re all familiar with the strong economic growth New Zealand has seen over recent years, compared with many other developed countries.

This is the result of hard work by businesses and the workers within them over a long period of time, and that needs to be acknowledged.

But the message we’ve heard from New Zealanders is that this strong growth has not translated into the kind of improvements to peoples’ living standards or wellbeing that we would all like to see.

On a per person basis growth has barely got above 1%.  Household debt is high, and rates of child poverty have not declined.

In its 2018 State of the Nation report, the Salvation Army made the point that “it is clear that the benefits of this recent strong economic growth have not been shared across the board, or trickled down”.

All of you will have seen the results of this in one way or another. We’ve seen this manifest in many ways - in the increasing demand for food parcels, in the record numbers of homeless, and in the tens of thousands of our young people not in employment, education, or training.

I do not believe these are the signs of a successful economy or society.  Nor do I believe that there is anyone in our country, of any political persuasion who is happy with that situation.

Our Government believes that economic growth is a means to an end, not an end in itself. The actual purpose of growing our economy is to improve the wellbeing and living standards of New Zealanders.

To make this a reality we need to do things differently and we need to measure our success differently.  You will have heard about our 2019 Wellbeing Budget that will look at both the traditional indicators like GDP but also at the wellbeing of people, the environment and our communities.

Part of the reason we haven’t seen equitable growth in recent years is because of what’s been driving that growth. We’ve relied on an overheated housing market and record immigration to boost economic growth. These drivers of growth are unsustainable, pushing the home-ownership rate in New Zealand to its lowest level in 66 years and pushing demand for already stretched public services and infrastructure to the limit.

Simply buying and selling houses from one another and adding more people is not a long-term economic strategy.

We need a just transition towards an economy that is based on growth that is more productive, more sustainable and more inclusive.

What do I mean by that?

Productive means doing more with what we have, moving our products up the value chain, and producing things in new and innovative ways.

Sustainable means meeting the needs of the present without compromising our ability to do so in the future, both in an economic and in a fiscal sense.

Inclusive means ensuring that all New Zealanders get a fair go, have a chance to contribute to our economy, and get to share in the benefits of growth.

So that is the goal of our economic strategy.  A planned and just transition to a more productive, sustainable and inclusive economy, where we improve the living standards and wellbeing of all New Zealanders.

Budget 2018 within this strategy

Budget 2018 represents the first steps in this plan. We need strong foundations to make the transition our economy needs.

I am sure you have heard the highlights of the Budget by now. In this Budget we’ve identified Health, Housing and Education as those areas most in need of new investment.

We know that healthier, better educated people make us stronger as a nation. The $4 billion extra we’re spending on Health, and the $2 billion we’re spending on Education, will help to ensure that our workers are healthy and that our children and young people get the best opportunity to succeed.

In our 100 Day Plan we invested $2 billion in the KiwiBuild programme to build affordable housing for first time buyers. In this Budget the focus is on public housing.  We will build 6,400 more public houses over the next four years, and we will invest significant resources to tackle homelessness.

All of this is on top of the Families Package we passed before Christmas, that, when fully rolled out, will see 384,000 middle and low income families better off by an average of $75 per week.

We are making these investments while also managing the Government’s books responsibly. In Budget 18 we have met all of our Budget Responsibility Rules, in particular:

We’re delivering a sustainable operating surplus forecast to be $3.1 billion in 2017/18, rising to $7.3 billion by 2021/22.
	The Government is on track to reduce net core Crown debt below 20 percent of GDP within 5 years of taking office.
	We are taking a prudent approach to expenditure by limiting Government spending to below the recent historical average of 30 percent of GDP, with Treasury forecasts showing expenditure peaking at 28.5 percent in 2018/19.
Alongside making the important investments New Zealand needs right now, we are continuing to improve the Government’s fiscal position so that we can respond to any major shocks that could occur in the future, be they natural, economic or otherwise. All Governments should plan beyond the current term and take responsibility for future generations.

The Budget is clear that we can pay for every commitment we are making by taking a more sensible approach to debt reduction, the reversal of the proposed tax cuts, increased revenue from a growing economy and some reprioritisation and new revenue measures.

Budget 2018 strikes the right balance between meeting short term needs and making long-term and sustained investments. It is the first step in a plan that has in mind not just the next 3 years, but also the next 30.

Partnering with business

The Budget also outlines our plan to future-proof the New Zealand economy. We know that we cannot do this alone, and neither should we. We need the expertise and investment of all our social partners, including those in business, to turn this vision for New Zealand into a reality.

Today I want to talk in a bit more detail about some of the focus areas for our Business Partnership Agenda.

Infrastructure

There is growing pressure on infrastructure right around New Zealand. Nowhere is that more evident than in Auckland. This city is projected to grow in size by another one million people over the next 30 years. Congestion is already costing Auckland between $1-2 billion a year in lost productivity.

In response we recently announced the ATAP package in partnership with the Auckland Council, which will see a record $28 billion worth of new investment into Auckland’s transport network over the next 10 years. This includes around $8.4 billion for the construction of rapid transit, including light rail, and also about $940 million for heavy rail improvements.

This transport expenditure is a critical part of our overall infrastructure and urban development agenda.

Delivering on this agenda will be a partnership with the private sector. Minister Twyford and I recently announced a procurement exercise and market sounding for the delivery of the next two light rail lines in this city. We are open to a range of financing options to deliver this. We welcome the interest of the NZ Super Fund in leading a consortium to do this work. Their offer will be considered alongside others to...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic)
