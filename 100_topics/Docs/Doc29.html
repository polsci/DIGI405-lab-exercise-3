I’d like to acknowledge the Mayor of Hamilton Andrew King, MP Jamie Strange, Deputy Mayors and City and Regional Councillors.
It is a privilege to be here in the Waikato, and Hamilton in particular. This region is experiencing high levels of growth which are the envy of other parts of New Zealand. Projections show Hamilton is well on its way to being a city with more than 200,000 residents by 2034 and 225,000 by 2041, effectively adding the current population of Palmerston North to the city in that time.
This growth is partly due to Hamilton’s strategic location in the Golden Triangle, along with Auckland and Tauranga. This area is extremely important to both this region’s and our country’s economic growth. 
This Government wants to help this city grow with a new policy platform to tackle housing and transport bottlenecks, while driving regional development and sustainable growth opportunities. 
But before I go into our priorities for the next three years, I want to provide an update on a project which the Hamilton City Council applied for funding for under the previous Government’s Housing Infrastructure Fund, in the Peacockes area. The previous Government did have some good ideas, but it shouldn’t take a housing crisis for a Government to act.
The funding sought would open up residential land for 3,750 new houses in the Peacockes area within the next 10 years, rising to a total of 8,400 homes in this area in 30 years’ time. As you know, the land is already zoned and designations are in place.
And I’m pleased to be able to tell you today that Ministers have accepted the business case for Peacockes. Final documentation is being worked on by officials and Hamilton City Council staff, and the Council still needs to consult the community through its long-term plan process. But we expect that construction can start in earnest when long-term plan approval is gained in June.
Within this plan, a new southern link road, connecting to the existing State Highway 1 on the western side of Hamilton, will swing past the southern edge of Peacockes, also linking a new Airport Employment zone with the eastern side of the city. 
From my perspective the theme of today’s conference, ‘From Change Comes Opportunity” could not be more appropriate. I am humbled by the privilege and opportunity that is presented from being in Government and being the Minister of Finance.  It is most certainly a change – and one that I am relishing.
Earlier this week at Waitangi, we also saw the opportunity that comes from change. Jacinda Ardern became the first female New Zealand Prime Minister allowed to speak from the veranda of the Upper Marae. It was an historic moment which I was privileged to witness first-hand. 
There was a different feeling at Waitangi this year. A spirit of respect and inclusion replaced some of the rancour and divisiveness of previous years. From both the Government and Maori there was an expressed desire to work together identifying the opportunities and challenges that we need to face up to as a country.
The Prime Minister called on Maori to hold the new Government to account over how our policies dealt with social depravation, mental health, the environment and generational equity. It is not for me to repeat her speech word for word to a different audience. But I do want to paraphrase a few lines she gave towards the end of her address, regarding the need to work together on addressing the issues we do face as a nation.
She said that, as a Government, we know our nation’s failings and we have an idea of what we want to do to fix them. But we won’t always, alone, know exactly how to change things. For that, we will come to you. Now, the Prime Minister was referring to Maori, but I wish to convey that message to this audience, and the business community across New Zealand as well.
We will ask you to help us; we will form partnerships together because we cannot – and should not – be doing it alone. And as we get out to speak to more of you, there will be none too small who we don’t ask for advice and to work alongside us as we look to grow this economy in a sustainable and fair way.
Broadly expressed, the economic strategy of our government is to improve the wellbeing and living standards of New Zealanders through sustainable, productive and inclusive growth. We will be responsible with our management of the economy running sustainable surpluses and reducing debt as a proportion of the economy.
Now you might think those sound like catch phrases.  But they are our guiding principles and behind each of them is a set of plans and policies that we will be developing and rolling out, with your, and the rest of New Zealand’s, input and help.
Our Budget Responsibility Rules will ensure that we keep Government spending at about 30% of GDP – in line with the two previous governments. And we have set a target to reduce net debt to 20% of GDP within five years of taking office. This will ensure the Government remains well-placed to help the economy respond to large economic shocks or natural disasters.
Treasury’s Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update released in December shows we can achieve these goals.
With our policy programme, we are setting out to “do this”, but we aren’t setting out to do this alone. As a Government, we have a set of policies which we believe are needed at this point in New Zealand’s economic story to give every New Zealander a fair chance to contribute to, and benefit from, our prosperity.
There is no denying that we came in to Government against an interesting economic backdrop. I know you will hear from other speakers today on the overall economic environment, but suffice to say the high level indicators in the economy are positive and all the more so in comparison to other places in the world.
But that’s not to say everything is perfect or that we cannot do better. In particular, New Zealand needs to address deficits in both our social and physical infrastructure.
During the election campaign, by far the biggest issue raised with me about the economy was that too many people had missed out on a share in the prosperity that we as a nation were creating. I received this message from boardrooms to smoko rooms around the country.  No one is comfortable with high levels of homelessness or child poverty in a beautiful and prosperous country such as ours. We don’t want to see home ownership and financial security as the privilege of the few.
Too many people are missing out, and New Zealanders want to see that change. We have heard that message, and as a government we are committed to addressing it.
That is why the centrepiece of our mini-Budget before Christmas was a Families Package that unashamedly targets those on low and middle incomes. While tax cuts might sound attractive, right now the priority is to provide better-focused support particularly to those who are raising children. We have introduced a Best Start payment for children in their first three years and boosted Working for Families. Our package will see 385,000 families better off by an average of $75 p...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic)
