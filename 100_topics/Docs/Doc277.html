Thank you to the Wellington Chamber for hosting and thanks to all of you for making the time to be here.

I am delighted to be here to talk about the up-coming budget, and to tell you a little about what will be different, and indeed what will be the same.

There has been a fair amount of attention in the media here and internationally on this year’s budget – our country’s first Wellbeing Budget.

Enough for me to be invited to the recent Spring Meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, to talk about our approach.  Our ideas are interesting to many countries as they seek ways of building truly sustainable economies that deliver prosperity and fairness, and that build trust.

At those same meetings, global economic forecasts were further downgraded for 2019, after having been downgraded only six months earlier.  Global growth is now expected to be 3.3% for the year.  As the IMF Head Christine Lagarde said, the global economy is still growing, but it is growing more slowly. 

The IMF projections for New Zealand are that we will grow at around 2.5% in 2019 and 2.9% in 2020.  The average growth for advanced economies in the same period is projected to be 1.8% and 1.7% respectively.  We are projected to grow faster than the US, the UK, Japan, Canada, the Eurozone and Australia.  Indeed, just last week the Reserve Bank of Australia further lowered its 2019 growth forecast for the Australian economy from 2.5% to 1.75%.

There are certainly significant challenges in the global economy, and New Zealand is not immune to them.  The tariff war between the US and China has burst back into life, and was a major factor weighing on the minds of those I met with in Washington.  So too, the uncertainty created by Brexit and its impact across Europe.  All of this adds up to a global environment in which New Zealand exporters operate that is both unstable and uncertain.

Here at home we know that the fundamentals of our economy are strong.  We continue to have historically low unemployment and stable, low inflation. This is supported by budget surpluses and low public debt due to our Government’s responsible fiscal management. 

There has been a slowing of growth from the heights of recent years as the international situation impacts on New Zealand, and as both immigration and the housing market slow to more normal levels.  But we are well positioned to deal with this slowdown.  And we are holding up well.

Exports and commodity prices are up, as are building consents and consumer confidence.  There are challenges to lift business investment, but the base is there to see New Zealand through this challenging period.

Recently I even heard someone utter the “rockstar” word again in respect of our economy. Actually, it was the same person who said it the first time. While it is very flattering and the New Zealand economy is strong and we are doing better than many of our peers, I think it is a term best avoided.  

For many New Zealanders the use of this phrase was jarring when they heard it several years ago.  Sure, we had – and have – GDP growth rates that many other countries around the world envied, but for many New Zealanders, this GDP growth had not translated into higher living standards or better opportunities.  How could we be a rockstar, they asked, with homelessness, child poverty and inequality on the rise?

This gap between rhetoric and reality was in many senses the defining issue of the 2017 election, and what led to the formation of the Coalition Government.

This gap between rhetoric and reality, between haves and have-nots, between the elites and the people, has been exploited by populists around the globe.

It is a long-term view of mine, and the parties that make up this Government, that we need to close this gap in an inclusive, not exclusive way, because it is the right thing to do and because we need to do so to ensure the public keep faith and trust in government.

To do this we need a different view of what constitutes success.

GDP remains an important measure of activity in an economy, but it doesn’t tell us about the quality of that activity.

We still have thousands of young people not in employment, education or training. The home ownership rate has fallen to its lowest rate in over 60 years. We have one of the highest youth suicide rates in the OECD. Hundreds of thousands of children are growing up in poverty. And Māori and Pasifika continue to experience poor outcomes.  

For me, a simple growth rate is just not sufficient to tell us what success looks like.

Our Government will measure its success by how well we improve the living standards and wellbeing of all New Zealanders.  Yes, we need prosperity, but we also need to care about how we sustain and maintain that and who gets to share in it.

In order to succeed in this, we need all the tools available to the Government to consider wider wellbeing outcomes, to ensure that everything the government does is done explicitly to improve the lives of New Zealanders.

The government does not dictate a person’s wellbeing. But if we make improving wellbeing our purpose then we have a decent shot at helping improve the lives of all our people.

Obviously one of the most powerful tools available to the Government is the budget. This year we’ve put wellbeing at the heart of the budget process.

Wellbeing has certainly become something of a buzz word lately, so I want to take the opportunity today to explain what the Budget will mean for you, your companies, and for New Zealand.

For me, wellbeing means people living lives of purpose, balance and meaning to them, and having the capabilities to do so.

There are three fundamental elements to our wellbeing plan.

First, a whole-of-government approach. This is about stepping out of the silos of agencies and working together to assess, develop and implement initiatives to improve wellbeing.

Secondly, a wellbeing approach means looking at intergenerational outcomes.  We have to think about the long-term impacts on future generations at the same time as meeting the needs of the present.

Thirdly, we need to move beyond narrow measures of success. 

The Treasury’s Living Standards Framework is at the core of our approach to this Budget, but the Government also has other success measures to draw on as well, such as child wellbeing and poverty indicators, and Statistics New Zealand’s Indicators Aotearoa New Zealand. Taken together, these are steps forward in giving ourselves a much richer picture of how we are tracking as a country.

Ultimately the wellbeing approach still needs to help us make better decisions, identifying trade-offs and balancing outcomes.

I’m sure many of you will have experience in making difficult trade-offs in the business world. Perhaps you’ve had to weigh up a payoff in the short term and reputational impacts on your brand over the longer term.

A wellbeing approach is about taking a wider view, recognising and weighing up the overall pros and cons of government policy on all of the things that enable New Zealanders to live lives of purpose and value.

It is important to note that the wellbeing approach is more than just the budget.  Our job is to ensure that the whole system of government is geared towards improving wellbeing and living standards. 

The focus at budget time is on new spending, but there is much to do to make sure that the baseline and core expenditure is aligned to our goals. I will have more to say about this in the coming weeks, but we have to ensure our legislative framework, planning, reporting and accountability arrangements shift to support the wellbeing approach.

Functionally, this requires a different approach to the way budgets have been done in the past.

Previous budgets have essentially been a contestable fund.  Individual agencies would develop and submit bids. The Finance Minister and a small group of other Ministers then made relatively arbitrary decisions on what would and wouldn’t be funded.

So what is different about this budget?

Fundamentally, this year we have taken a much more strategic approach to the budget’s development and production.

The budget priorities have been developed on the basis of a wellbeing analysis. We have looked at the evidence to assess where we have the greatest opportunities to make a difference to New Zealanders’ wellbeing and we have focused our efforts on those opportunities.

To inform this analysis we have drawn on demographic and other data from the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework dashboard, as well as other evidence and advice from science advisors and other sector experts.

This information does not necessarily tell us what interventions we should make, but it shines a powerful light on where interventions are most needed, and where we can make the biggest difference. 

The Wellbeing Budget priorities developed from this approach are:

Creating opportunities for productive businesses, regions, iwi and others to transition to a sustainable and low-emissions economy;
	Supporting a thriving nation in the digital age through innovation, social and economic opportunities;
	Reducing child poverty and improving child wellbeing, including addressing family violence;
	Supporting mental wellbeing for all New Zealanders, with a special focus on under 24-year-olds; and
	Lifting Māori and Pacific incomes, skills and opportunities.
These represent some of the biggest long-term challenges and opportunities that we face as a country.  They will not be solved in one go. These are obviously complex, multi-faceted issues, requiring sustained attention and a collaborative, joined-up government. 

Ultimately, like in business, investments should align with strategy. I’m sure all of you agree that expenditure should not be undertaken in isolation; it needs to be in coordination and alignment with the outcomes you seek.

Previously, Ministers and agencies have been able to focus almost exclusively on their particular areas of responsibility in the budget process. But this year multiple agencies and Ministers have been expected to contribute towards the budget priorities, and to show how their proposals are contributing to overall wellbeing. 

We know that the old silo approach has not worked. Complex issues like mental health, climate change, the future of work and child poverty require a multi-agency collaborative approach. We have been strongly encouraging collaboration among agencies in the development of Budget bids.

I’m excited by the joint initiatives that have come through this process.

For example, last week we announced the Wellbeing Budget will contain funding for a new pathway for Māori high-security prisoners. The initiative is co-designed by Whānau Ora, Corrections, the Ministry of Social Development and iwi, and aims to tackle the long-term challenge of Māori overrepresentation in the prison system.

In developing this initiative, we looked at the evidence. We know that 76 per cent of those in high security settings identify as either Māori or Pacific. We also know that of that 76 percent, some 53 percent of them are released from high security. The reimprisonment rates of people released from high security are above 70 percent.

Former Chief Science Advisor, Sir Peter Gluckman noted that previous responses to addressing the incarceration rate for Māori have largely been individualised, ineffective, and guided by non-Māori world views.

The new pathway will enable people to experience a Māori and whānau-centred approach for all of their time with Corrections, from pre-sentence to reintegration and transition in their community. It will initially focus on Māori men under 30 years of age, as this group has the highest reconviction and reimprisonment rates.

This initiative acknowledges that our system does not work for Māori. The answer is not just another programme. This is a system change, a culture change inside our prisons to adopt a strengths-based approach to rehabilitation.

For me, this is a great example of the wellbeing approach in action.  Multiple agencies coming together to address a long-term challenge with an evidence-based and expert-informed approach.  The payoff will be a long term one that will have massive social and economic benefits.  As former Prime Minister Bill English once said, prisons are a moral and fiscal failure.  This initiative
