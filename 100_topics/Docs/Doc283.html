It is my pleasure to welcome you all to the 2019 Pacific Environmental Security Forum. New Zealand is proud to host this year’s Forum alongside the United States Indo-Pacific Command, and to have so many of our Pacific neighbours in attendance. 
I would like to acknowledge the United States Ambassador to New Zealand, Scott Brown and the French Ambassador to New Zealand, Her Excellency Sylvaine Carta-Le Vert, Timor Leste Ambassador Cristiano De Costa.   
Over the course of this Forum, you will discuss topics of paramount importance to Asia-Pacific security. 
These include the intensifying impacts of climate change, climate migration, biosecurity, resource protection, tangible environmental security solutions and environmental security transformation. 
The primary theme for this year’s Forum is Building Resilience in the Pacific. This is particularly important. Our Pacific Island partners are disproportionately affected by the impacts climate change—the western Pacific Ocean is rising at about three times the global average rate of around three millimetres annually. 
In my first attendance at the Shangri-La Dialogue in June 2018, I and the French Minister of Defence led discussions on what we saw as a critical threat to security. 
At the September 2018 Pacific Islands Forum, the leaders of our neighbourhood, including New Zealand, affirmed that “climate change presents the single greatest threat to the livelihood, security and wellbeing of Pacific people”. 
Discussions on climate change, defence and security were front and centre during my recent visit to Fiji for the South Pacific Defence Ministers’ Meeting. 
We recognised climate change as a challenge that regional defence organisations must be ready for. 
Recommendations on advancing collective work by regional militaries and defence establishments on climate change, defence and security following a coordinated study, led by France, commissioned by the meeting in 2017, received unanimous support. 
Key components of this future work are in lock step with the goals of the Pacific Environmental Security Forum, including the sharing of best practice in a range of areas from policy development, education and awareness-raising and civilian-military collaboration. 
The importance of the networks you will form this week cannot be overstated. Strong and enduring civilian-military partnerships across the Asia-Pacific will enhance stability and security.
New Zealand’s vast maritime profile, encompassing waters from Antarctica through the South Pacific and to the Equator is fundamental to the wellbeing of New Zealand and our Pacific neighbours. 
Challenges in this domain are visible and intensifying.
New Zealand’s collaborative work with our partners, such as the Navy working with Fiji to patrol its EEZ for illegal fishing, aims to protect natural resources for future generations.
New Zealand also collaborates with partners in Antarctica where scientists are conducting ground-breaking climate change research.  The new Zealand Defence Force plays a critical role in enabling this important work, and it is through doing that work it is seeing first-hand the effects of Climate Change and its consequences. 
The impacts of climate change are challenging community resilience and working to exacerbate a range of challenges from transnational crime, resource competition and climate-induced migration. 
In December, in conjunction with New Zealand’s Minister for Climate Change the Hon James Shaw, we released The Climate Crisis: Defence readiness and responsibilities assessment. This assessment reinforces New Zealand’s view that climate change is one of the greatest security challenges of our time. You will receive a presentation on this piece of work today. 
The Pacific region is facing increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events leading to a range of environmental impacts such as coral bleaching, decreasing fish stocks and increased soil salinization—all have flow-on economic, cultural and social consequences.
When coupled with increased rainfall and deforestation the results are catastrophic – land subsidence, slips, erosion, and loss of biodiversity to name a few.  
It is important to take lessons from the past to better inform our future. Whilst it is some time ago, in May 1840 a devastating landslide destroyed the Ngati Tuwharetoa village of Te Rapa on the South West shore of Lake Taupo, killing sixty people.  This environmental disaster remains New Zealand’s highest death toll from a landslide.  Such events will become more frequent. 
More recently two of the most destructive tropical storms in the South Pacific have occurred in the past few years.  Cyclones Winston and Gita caused widespread destruction in 2016 and 2018 respectively. The New Zealand Defence Force supported and will continue to support the New Zealand Government to provide humanitarian assistance to those affected.
Over time there will be an increased requirement for our Defence and other security forces to respond with humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, more search and rescue missions, and potentially stability operations. All of this means we need to think about capability. 
We also need to think about incorporating traditional and indigenous knowledge with contemporary methods will allow us to establish projects that merge strategies that have been successful for centuries, with technology and methods of response that can enhance resiliency for future generations. 
Sustainable practices are not only important for the protection of human life, they are also important for the protection of natural life. The Pacific is home to a broad indigenous biodiversity that is important to our national identities and economic wellbeing.  However, our unique flora and fauna are at risk from biosecurity hazards and threats that are already present. Those that are present and dormant, and those that arrive but which normally would not survive...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic)
