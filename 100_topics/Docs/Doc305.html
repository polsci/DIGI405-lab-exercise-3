Ladies and Gentlemen, 
 Kia Ora Koutou, Buenos Dias, Ni Hao, Konichi wa, Hola, Ola
 I am very pleased to be here this morning, and to have the opportunity to address this important conference on the Southern Link; the idea of connecting Asia and South America via New Zealand. 
 I’d like to set out the Coalition Government’s perspective on how the idea of a Southern Link fits into our wider strategy of increasing regional economic integration. We like to do this in ways that build general prosperity and improve the welfare of our people. I’ll also offer some thoughts on what implementation could look like.
 New Zealand is a developed, trading nation geographically distant from its markets. For much of our history, our isolated geography was seen as a disadvantage. “The tyranny of distance” as Split Enz put it.  Now this is diminishing, as long haul jet aircraft technology improves links and reduces tourists’ perceptions of distance.  
 Our location is increasingly an advantage.  It means we can manage pests and diseases at the border in a way that few other countries can. Yet Asia and South America are now within direct flights from New Zealand. The growth of Asia has meant that for the first time in history, our location is adjacent to the fastest growing markets on the planet. Geography that was once a trading disadvantage, is now a strategic opportunity for our diversified and regionally integrated economy.
 Currently 53% of New Zealand exports go to Asia and around 13% to the Americas. These rely on trans-Pacific shipping, and, for perishable goods and tourism, efficient air transport. Both forms of transport are critical to our economic well-being.  Continuing to improve the connections that allow New Zealanders and our trading partners to engage across the world helps us all.
 Some people here today may recall that New Zealand first discussed the idea of greater Asia-South America connectivity in FEALAC (Forum of East Asia-Latin America Cooperation) and in APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) in the 1990s. This is now an idea that’s time has come, for two reasons. 
 Firstly, trading nations in all parts of the world are seeking to access the growing economies of Asia. 
 Secondly, there is renewed effort to work on regional integration as a way to shore up options at a time when the international trading system is under pressure.
 Both South America and Asia understand that the current global trading system is struggling. We can no longer assume that a trend towards global market openness will continue and that the rule-based trading system will always strengthen and expand. We need to find the best ways to, as President Pinera put it, “navigate the world’s tempestuous waters.”  
 In New Zealand, we are focused on building our resilience through diversifying our trading relationships, engaging fully in the regional economy and supporting and reforming the institutions of global economic architecture, such as the WTO, that are critical to New Zealand.
 As a counterweight to scepticism about global trade it is important that international trade and development delivers genuine sustainable benefits to citizens. That has been a focus of our “Trade for All” and the revised CPTPP. We are currently negotiating FTAs with the Pacific Alliance grouping in South America, with the EU and an upgrade to our FTA with China. We continue to push forward with RCEP, all with this in mind. 
 We are aware of wider trends and actively seeking ways to support innovation.
 Cross border e-commerce now accounts for 8% of all retail spending in New Zealand. All indications are that global e-commerce will continue to increase. 
 Last month we announced negotiations with Singapore and Chile towards a new and pathfinding international agreement on digital trade and the digital economy. We want to establish new trade rules and best practices for the digital era.  
 These talks are an opportunity for New Zealand, with South American and Asian partners, to shape fair and practical international rules for the digital economy so that our businesses and consumers can take advantage of emerging digital trade opportunities.
 This initiative is consistent with our active support for the work of APEC. We are very supportive of Chile’s priorities in their hosting this year, which will continue to have an impact when New Zealand hosts APEC in 2021. 
 China
 New Zealand and China enjoy a strong relationship at the highest political level.
 I travelled to China in May to attend the 2nd Belt and Road Forum, and to lead a delegation of senior New Zealand business people. The Coalition Government recognises that the BRI is important to China and that it aspires to meet regional needs in some areas.  
 The question uppermost in my mind prior to the Forum, and the question also posed by my colleagues was how the BRI, alongside the many other regional initiatives New Zealand is engaged in, could contribute to New Zealand’s sustainable and inclusive economic development. 
 As an independent and developed economy, with an established plan for building and funding sustainable national infrastructure, we were not seeking the hard infrastructure that has been the focus of China’s BRI in developing countries. 
 New Zealand’s priorities under the BRI could include best practise business regulation as well as supporting the sustainability and transparency that we see as important for economic resilience and long term development.
We welcomed President Xi’s speech to this year’s Belt and Road Forum when he committed to address international concerns around transparency, debt and environmental sustainability. A BRI geared to supporting sustainable infrastructure in countries that require it, but which also values wider regional input and participation in ensuring open, competitive and transparent business environments, would be of genuine value in shaping regional development and commerce. 
South America
 Our relations with South America are linked to our relations with Asia.  We are sometimes competitors for customers but we share common interests in trade policy, open market access, quarantine systems and stable business environments.  Key institutions such as APEC and agreements like the CPTPP bring us together.  So does investment between our economies. International education also brings our young people together and creates enduring relationships which benef...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic)
