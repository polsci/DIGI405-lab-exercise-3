My usual Sunday routines were going as planned, relax all day with a good movie or a really awesome activity that lasts all day. I was feeling like I needed to watch a movie so I did. My dad joined me shortly after and I cannot say what movie we watched because of what happened afterwards. 
We were just getting to the good part of the movie when my Dad noticed that the light above our heads was moving side to side. When I was aware of what was happening  I didnâ€™t believe him but I realised that he was not hallucinating and the ground beneath me was shaking. 
Fear hit me like lightning and I started to do what the earth was already doing, shaking. I started to shake. I ran as quickly  as I could to stand underneath the door frame. My Dad came to me to tell me that everything was okay.  
My Mum and two sisters went to the mall in town. Trying to contact them was not easy. The phones were down and worry hit so hard I started to panic the thought of not being able to know whether  my mum and my sister were okay was torture. The next thing I knew I heard the car rolling up the drive and I breathed. A sigh of relief,  I was happy they were safe.
