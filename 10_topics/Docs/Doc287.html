Thank you to Craig’s Investments for hosting us today. I’m excited to be here a week out from this year’s Budget – the Wellbeing Budget.
This morning I want to offer some comments on the economic outlook in New Zealand and overseas, and to talk about the Government’s economic strategy.
I also want to set out for you how this year’s Wellbeing Budget supports that strategy and our overall policy agenda.
Global economic outlook
As a small open economy, located in the South Pacific, the global economic environment will always have a significant impact on our fortunes.  The living standards and wellbeing of New Zealanders are intertwined with the economies, and the politics of the rest of the world.
I recently attended the Spring Meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington DC, where the slowing global economy was the dominant topic of conversation.
At those meetings the IMF downgraded its global economic forecasts for 2019, after having downgraded them only six months earlier.  Global growth is now expected to be 3.3% for the year, with advanced economies growing 1.8%.  According to IMF Head Christine Lagarde, the global economy is still growing, but it is growing more slowly.  
There are significant challenges in the international environment.  
The tariff war between the US and China was – and still is – a major issue for those I met in Washington. It has flared up again in the last couple of weeks, with the US increasing tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports and China retaliating with tariffs of its own. The US has not ruled out further tariffs, which would place further pressure on a softening Chinese economy. In turn, the US economy is also showing signs of slowing.
Uncertainty in Europe, due in large part to Brexit, is ongoing. This further adds to the global economic headwinds we face.
All of this adds up to a global environment in which New Zealand exporters operate that is both unstable and uncertain. 
Domestic outlook
New Zealand is well positioned to face this instability and uncertainty, but we are not immune from its impacts. Growth rates are set to be lower than we have seen in recent years.
The IMF projections for New Zealand are that we will grow at around 2.5% in 2019 and 2.9% in 2020, which is ahead of our peers.  We are projected to grow faster than the US, the UK, Japan, Canada, the Eurozone and Australia.  Just recently the Reserve Bank of Australia further lowered its growth forecast for the Australian economy.
The OECD this week has also released new forecasts for the global economy. In their comments about New Zealand, they expect growth again ahead of our peers – with business investment expected to grow. 
 We know that the fundamentals of our economy are strong.  
We continue to have historically low unemployment and stable, low inflation. We are running Budget surpluses and have low public debt due to our Government’s responsible fiscal management.  
We are holding up well and are well positioned to deal with the global situation. 
Consumer confidence, export and, commodity prices, and building consents and are all up. Last week’s Performance of Manufacturing index lifted.  
Capacity constraints, particularly in a tight labour market, do remain a challenge.  The need for skilled staff is the most common refrain I hear from business. And we still have our entrenched levels of productivity. But overall we have a solid base to see New Zealand through this challenging period.
In addition to the volatile global environment there are the mega trends that we have to keep in mind. The full effect of the rapidly changing nature of work, driven by forces such as automation and globalisation is not yet known. But we do know from developments like cloud computing, 3D printing, Uber and even Netflix that these mega trends already are, and will continue to be, disruptive to the status quo. 
The recent report by McKinsey’s for the Prime Minister’s Business Advisory Council noted that around 21% of work activities in the New Zealand economy have the potential for automation by 2030.  This requires a significant shift in how we think about and plan for work.
And then there is the challenge of climate change that effects every aspect of our economy.   The urgency of our response has never been clearer, and New Zealand, with our reliance on a stable climate for a strong primary sector, has to move now to get ahead of the challenge. 
These issues, and others, provide us with both challenges and opportunities going forward, and how we respond will shape the future of New Zealand.
At the same time, we need to move away from the main factors driving economic growth in the recent past, namely housing and population growth. The benefits of growth based on these factors has failed to translate into meaningful improvements to the living standards of many New Zealanders. 
Buying and selling houses to one another and adding more people to the economy is not the basis of a sound economic strategy. 
Economic Strategy
In the face of this environment it is important to be clear about our economic strategy and plan. 
So, we are in a transition phase for our economy.
The core aim of our Government is to improve the living standards and wellbeing of all New Zealanders. Our success in achieving this will largely be determined by how adaptable and resilient we are to these challenges.
In short our Government’s vision is for a modern economy that is productive, sustainable and inclusive.
What do I mean by that?
Productive means doing more with what we have, moving our products up the value chain, and producing things in new and innovative ways.
Sustainable means meeting the needs of the present without compromising our ability to do so in the future, both in an environmental sense, and in an economic and fiscal sense.
Inclusive means ensuring that all New Zealanders get a fair go, have a chance to contribute to our economy, and get to share in the benefits of growth.
When the Prime Minister outlined the Government’s priorities last year she identified four economic objectives that will help deliver on this vision. These are to:
Grow and share New Zealand’s prosperity more fairly;
Support thriving and sustainable regions;
Transition to a clean, green and carbon neutral New Zealand; and
Deliver responsible governance with a broader measure of success.
One way to think about this is the six “I”s.
We need to develop more transparent and enduring institutions, and enhancing our social partnership.  We are making good progress here through, for example, reform of the Reserve Bank, the introduction of the Zero Carbon Bill and establishing the Climate Change Commission, and the establishment of the Tripartite Future of Work Forum bringing business, workers and Government to the table.
Our Investment priorities need to change.  New Zealand’s capital markets need to encourage more productive and sustainable investments. We have established Green Investment Finance, restarted contributions to the Super Fund and set about updating our Overseas Investment regime.
We need to do more with Innovation and our Innovative industries to drive productivity and shift from volume to value. We are leading the world with our work on a just transition towards a low carbon economy, highlighted by the recent summit in Taranaki.  We have already made significant investment in research and development including support for business R and D through the R and D Tax credit, and more is to come as we move towards our goal of two pe...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(70%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
