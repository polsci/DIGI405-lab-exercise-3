Good morning Madam Ambassador, other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.
 It is a pleasure to be here today at the fourth China Business Summit. Events like this enrich the conversation around one of our key relationships. 
Of course New Zealand’s economic relationship with China continues to boom. New Zealand businesses and innovators across the board – from dairy exporters, to tourism operators, to researchers – continue to find new opportunities between our two countries.
Today I will focus my comments on our strong and constructive bilateral relationship with China, the government’s priorities for trade and how these relate to China, before turning to comment on the interests we share in maintaining a global rules-based order.
 China trade relationship
 Last December, New Zealand celebrated 45 years of diplomatic relations with China. That occasion was an opportunity to chart the staggering development we have witnessed in the bilateral relationship since its modest beginnings.  
China is now one of New Zealand’s most significant political, economic and cultural partners. And we are proud to have a strong and constructive bilateral relationship with China. 
Trade and economic ties have proven to be some of the most vibrant and dynamic elements of our relationship with China. This year marks a decade since the last Labour Government signed a landmark Free Trade Agreement with China. 
It is quite clear that the FTA brought about structural changes in our trading relations that in turn brought significant economic benefit to both countries. Two-way trade more than tripled in the intervening years.  
China is now neck and neck with Australia as our largest export market for goods and services. 
For New Zealand, our FTA with China is a clear demonstration of the fundamental importance of trade liberalisation, as part of the global rules-based order. This is a topic I will return to in a moment.   
We have seen the tourism sector thrive between our two countries. China is our fastest growing source of visitors, and we were pleased to welcome over 400,000 tourists from China last year. New Zealanders visiting China are also at an all-time high. Next year, New Zealand and China will celebrate a bilateral year of tourism.  
Education is another important way to grow the foundations for mutual understanding between our two countries. China is the largest source of international students in New Zealand, numbering over 34,000.  
Investment is another important facet of the relationship. New Zealand welcomes foreign investment where it can be proven to bring productive economic growth to our country. This is where our screening regime comes in. It is a privilege, not a right, to invest in New Zealand. Our screening regime is open, transparent and country‑neutral and provides New Zealanders with the assurance that investment from overseas will bring benefits to New Zealand.
