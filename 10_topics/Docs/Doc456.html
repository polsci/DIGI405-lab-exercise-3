When the September earthquake hit I woke up but I didn’t know what was going on.I thought that it was my sister being silly and shaking my bunks but then I heard my mirror smash and I knew it wasn’t my sister.After that I had been thinking it was a robber.You can’t blame me for thinking that because I was only six years old.                                                                 
At that time I was really scared and then I heard Mum yell that it was an earthquake.”I don’t know what that is”, I said, then Mum came running into my room and grabbed my sister and I.By that time I was crying and I was really scared; somehow I went back to sleep on my mum. 
When I woke up we all looked around our house and everything had either fallen over or smashed.We had all this glass stuff on a shelving unit and it was smashed all over the floor.      
 We then went outside to see all this liquefaction all over the ground.People had already been out shoveling off the concrete all this grey stuff that looked and smelled really bad.
An earthquake is a series of vibrations induced in the earth’s crust by the abrupt rupture and rebound of rocks in which elastic strain has been slowly building up.
I never knew how an earthquake worked until I got a  bit older and found out.To be honest thinking back to when that happend it is really scary thinking of  the earthquake that broke a lot (and I mean a lot) of our stuff.When I  had finally gone outside again it was horrifying the sight of all this luiquefaction and cracks all through the ground. It was weird thinking that a few big shakes could do all this in as little as 40 second.        
It is scary thinking back to that time- 4:35am – and about being in that house. The other day I drove past it and remembered that night and how creepy it was. It’s still creepy because there are aftershocks still going on from that earthquake and the one after that.
