Da jia hao. Good morning distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for this opportunity to speak at the China Business Summit.
It is a great pleasure to share my thoughts on one of New Zealand’s key relationships, for the second time at this event.
New Zealand’s trading relationship with China itself is one of our most important and far reaching. It continues to thrive – creating new opportunities between our two countries.
Today I would like to focus my comments on our bilateral relationship with China, my recent trade mission to China, before commenting on how this government is navigating the choppy currents of the global trading environment.
Bilateral relationship with China
Let me start with the obvious: China matters to New Zealand.
Our two countries have significant political, economic and people-to-people links. We have deep history – the first Chinese immigrants to New Zealand arrived over 150 years ago. I’m from Dunedin and China settlers have left a strong mark there. Their descendants are strong partners in business and civil society.
China is our largest trading partner, largest source of overseas students, and second-largest source of overseas visitors.
Around 200,000 New Zealanders, or four per cent of the population, now are of Chinese ancestry, with the community having grown significantly since its 19th Century gold rush origins.
As the Prime Minister outlined earlier, her recent visit to Beijing has demonstrated how New Zealand and China enjoy a strong relationship at the highest political level. Given our vibrant trading relationship, it will come as no surprise that there was a strong trade and economic component to the Prime Minister’s visit.
Another key topic of discussion during the Prime Minister’s visit was strengthening and improving the multilateral trading system. I will also return to this when I turn to the topic of turbulent times for the global trading system.
Recent trade mission to China
My visit three weeks after the Prime Minister’s visit helped to maintain the positive momentum of our relationship with China.
This was my second visit to China in less than six months. I visited in November last year at the time of the International Import Expo in Shanghai.
I had three key objectives:
To learn more about the Belt and Road Initiative to identify opportunities for mutually beneficial and transparent cooperation;
To support New Zealand businesses with an interest in China; and
To engage with senior Chinese political and business leaders to advance issues that matter to both countries.I was proud to be accompanied by a delegation of senior New Zealand business representatives throughout the visit. They included leaders of successful food and beverage industries, the creative sector, tourism and logistics. It also included Chinese NZ business people who have succeeded in leading New Zealand business in China in the healthcare sector.  I was struck by t...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(58%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
