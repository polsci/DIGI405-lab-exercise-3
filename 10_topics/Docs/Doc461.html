Wake up! earthquake EARTHQUAKE!” My dad shouted at me as he shaked me awake. Wearily, I opened my eyes. Darkness was what I saw, but then I realised that it wasn’t my dad who was shaking me awake. Furniture rattled as I heard a deep rumbling sound coming from the ground. At first, I was confused. Why are my parents yelling at me to get up? Back then, I never realised how serious the situation actually was. In my 7 year old mind, it was just the ground shaking. 
I went down the stairs wearily and turned on the lights. Only when I realised that no lights light up did I actually panic. My grandparents were up as well and we all quickly got into the car as the ground shook.
My memory was a bit fuzzy, but I remember that we immediately got into the car right outside. After a while, everything went silent. I may be wrong, but I think that it was a Friday when this happened. That meant I had violin the next morning.

When morning came, we drove to my violin place, which was an old building sort of similar to a church. As we got there, I saw that there were some buildings that once stood so tall collapsed and white rubble almost everywhere. That’s strange, I thought. When we got there, we found that the building collapsed into rubble. A man in an orange baseball cap was looking around the shattered foundation. I was confused as I also thought about the other buildings.
