You have probably heard we have had a large aftershock, or may be a new quake, its not clear yet which.
Because this one happened at 1 pm on a work day there is loss of life this time and because of the epicentre 10 Km south of Chch and only 5 Km deep there is much more damage to already weakened old brick buildings, particularly in the city centre.
As with the September Eq the worst suburban damage is in the east of the city where liquefaction is again predominant. We feel very fortunate  to live in the Northwest of the city.
As far as we are concerned we are all OK although we had two of our family working in the city so we had a few anxious hours until they turned up ( The phones being either down or clogged) 
i will write again in a few days.
