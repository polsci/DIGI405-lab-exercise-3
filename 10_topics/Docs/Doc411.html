There was a cool wind and a few spots of rain.  
I had been looking forward to that day because it was to be the Hillmorton High School Swimming Sports  -a day of colour and competition and noise in the sunshine. But it was not to be. Over breakfast, I listened to the radio, which announced the Swimming Sports was cancelled, except for serious swimmers, who could race at Halswell Pool in the rain.
I wasn’t really a serious swimmer, but I thought I’d have a go. Some builder was plastering the ceiling as I left -the final repairs from the September earthquakes. I biked to Halswell Pool and worried about how cold the air temperature was. There was only one other year nine there,  a guy called Chris, who I knew to be a better swimmer than me. He bet me in every single race that morning, but not by much. 
So when I dived into the pool at 12:51, I was feeling tired and frustrated, but I thought ‘this might be the one where I beat Chris’. I was in the far outside lane, and as I glided through the water, I saw the centre line of the lane wobble like a snake. I dismissed it.  The waves were huge, so swimming forward was really very difficult. I managed to do two lengths before a wave crashed over me, knocking my breath away. I stood up, putting my feet on the bottom and my head out of the water.
