Hon Nanaia Mahuta – Minister of Local Government
Thank you very much to all of the attendees and speakers who have come to be part of this Water Summit today and tomorrow.
I would like to take the opportunity to thank Local Government New Zealand, Water New Zealand, and the Institute of Public Works Engineering Australasia (IPWEA) for organising this event.
Our Government sees the three waters system as critical for the health, well-being, and prosperity of our communities.  However, this system faces some significant challenges.
Over the next two day speakers will talk about these challenges in detail.  Hon Lyn Stevens QC will talk about the findings of the Havelock North Inquiry.  Helen Wyn and Malcolm Alexander will talk about the funding challenges.
We will also hear about possible solutions. Mr Marcus Rink will talk about the United Kingdom’s arrangements for regulation.  We will hear from a number of speakers about different models for service delivery - from Wellington Water and Watercare in New Zealand to the Tasmanian model from Mike Brewster.  I want to thank our overseas guests for coming here and sharing their expertise.
In working toward solutions, what is clear is that this is a conversation we need to have together.  Neither central nor local government can address these challenges alone. 
The conversation we will have over the next two days is essential to the journey we are about to take. If we engage in the right conversation with a strategic view in mind we may reach our destination in good order.
The three waters system as a whole is one of New Zealand’s critical sectors.  It provides the fundamental building blocks for our towns, communities and cities.
We all need high quality, reliable drinking water and wastewater services.  Our towns, roads and public spaces are not liveable without stormwater services.   Our environment depends upon water infrastructure services these services, particularly our streams, rivers and beaches –future proofing of wastewater and stormwater is at the core of this.
The challenges facing drinking water, the environmental challenges, and the need to move to a new regulatory system are significant which is why we are here today.
The findings of the Havelock North Inquiry have been a sobering reminder of how, for the sake of our communities, we must make sure that drinking water services are high quality and safe.  The drinking water in our cities is, by and large, world class.  However, too many areas in New Zealand do not meet drinking water standards, and as our communities get smaller, the level of compliance drops to 25 per cent.
The Inquiry has made significant recommendations – both to overhaul regulation, and also to change how services are provided. This is an important conversation that we must have. We need a step change to minimise the risk of a repeat of the tragic outcome of Havelock North happening again.
The Department of Internal Affairs commissioned a report from Beca on the costs to upgrade drinking water infrastructure to meet key recommendations made by the Inquiry.  This report is available on the Three Waters Review website.
Helen Wyn from the Department is going to speak about Beca’s report in more detail.  What I would like to emphasise to you now is that this report shows that the costs are highest for our smallest communities.  Our small towns and provincial areas have fallen behind, and the cost of upgrading their drinking water infrastructure will effectively be unaffordable for many of them.
It is clear from this work that the small communities cannot do it alone.
It is also clear that three waters services are facing significant environmental challenges in many areas across the country.
The Ministry for the Environment’s report Our Fresh Water 2017 shows that in urban areas, freshwater quality is significantly worse both for E. coli and nitrate concentrations than in rural farming areas.
The reasons are closely linked with wastewater and stormwater systems.  Many wastewater and stormwater networks were built decades ago and have very long term resource consents.  These are legacy issues, which we are now having to deal with as those consents come up for renewal.
Councils have just finished consulting with their communities about their long-term plans.  Many are considering how to fund infrastructure upgrades to meet freshwater objectives under the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management.  Many are considering how to meet community expectations about wastewater overflows into streams or at beaches.
These are challenges everywhere – in our cities, towns, and rural areas.  In Auckland, for example, the Council has consulted on a targeted rate in its long-term plan to fund water infrastructure to clean up the city's harbours and beaches.
It will not be possible to improve freshwater quality, particularly in urban areas, without tackling waters infrastructure.
There are also significant challenges in the regulation of the three waters that we need to consider also.
The Havelock North Inquiry has called for significant reform of drinking water regulation.  This includes a move to a dedicated drinking water regulator and much better monitoring, reporting, compliance and enforcement.  The Inquiry has said that affordability should no longer be a reason for failing to meet drinking water standards.
The Three Waters Review, led by the Department of Internal Affairs, has found that regulation across the three waters system is inconsistent and patchy.
There are low levels of compliance, monitoring and enforcement across the system – particularly for environmental monitoring.
There is inadequate oversight and connections between key parts of the system.
Information about three waters services is often not transparent, and does not promote accountability or improvement. 
Many consumers have to dig deep into annual reports to find out what is happening in their area.
We need to have a conversation about what a new regulatory system might look like.  Changes to regulation – whether they involve better reporting, oversight, compliance, or transparency – have the potential to have significant funding implications for local government, which is largely responsible for three waters services.
As a country we are facing some tough questions relating to three waters services.  For example: 
How do we achieve our housing aspirations and meet the increasing demand for water infrastructure driven by urban growth?
How can we ensure communities and visitors everywhere have access to safe and high quality drinking water?
How can communities with small or declining rating bases fund renewals of ageing infrastructure?  Or cope with the pressure placed on water services by tourists?  
How can we meet community expectations and improve environmental outcomes – particularly for the quality of our freshwater and beaches?  How can we ensure that wastewater and stormwater is properly treated?  
How do we respond to climate change?
These are all questions that we need to answer.   Many councils have been investing heavily in their water infrastructure, and deserve to be recognised for that.  However, the challenges we are facing as a nation are too great for individual councils, communities, or the government to tackle alone.
The biggest question is whether we are brave enough to move away from the status quo and be open to do things differently for the good of the country and all our communities.The problems are system-wide.  The solutions will require system-wide, collaborative change.  Central government and local government will need to work together to find solutions that are appropriate for communities everywhere.
We will also need to consider how our larger urban populations can help the smaller towns and provincial areas, and how to spread resources, expertise and technology across the country.
We need to look at both regulation and service delivery arrangements if we are going to achieve system-wide improvements.  Just targeting one side of the ledger will not be enough.
For regulation, we will be looking at options that improve public health, environment, and economic regulation for each of the three waters.  We are looking overseas for examples of what has worked elsewhere.  The solutions will however need to work for a New Zealand context.  We can learn from other countries, but solutions need to be founded in our own context.
For service delivery, we will be focusing on two key areas – capability and funding.
Capability – will be looking for ways to lift capability and capacity everywhere.  This is one of the biggest challenges facing our country.  One of the key findings of the Three Waters Review was that many communities are struggling to attract and retain the highly specialist technical skills necessary to run water infrastructure and manage assets.
Here we are talking about people – the Drinking Water Assessors, the Council staff, the engineers and others who work “on the ground” throughout New Zealand.  Many of you are here today.  You are our most valuable asset, and I want to acknowledge that.  We want to foster your specialist technical skills, and find ways to deliver you career paths so you have security, collegiality, and progression.    New Zealand is a small country, and water infrastruc...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(53%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(34%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(4%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(2%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
