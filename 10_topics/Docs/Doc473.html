There was a small quake, and a woman tending her garden and I held on to her fence for a bit, waiting for it to pass.

“Are you leaving Christchurch this weekend?” she asked.

“No, is there a reason why I should?”.

“Lots of people are getting away to miss the big quake” she said.

“What big quake?”

“The one Ken Ring predicted.  It’s all to do with the tides, you see”.

“Ken Ring.  Oh yes – the Moon man.  He is the one that a year’s predicts each day’s weather over the course of a year based on the tides.  Because the Moon’s gravity pulls the tides he thinks that affects the weather”.

“I don’t know about that.  But what he says is that a full moon pulls the earth’s crust, like it pulls the tides, and that will create a Mag. 4 earthquake about noon.” she said.

She goes on to say that Ken Ring has predicted that there will be a Christchurch (or maybe Marlborough) quake of Magnitude 4 by noon on 20 March 2011.  Mr Ring is not very clear about where the predicted earthquake will occur.  

“I’m not planning to go anywhere.” I said “Are you?”

“Oh yes. We’re heading to Timaru. I’m tired of quakes” she said.
People are not thinking rationally.  They want certainty in their life.  Scientists are giving probabilities and Mr Ring is giving certainties.
The moon’s gravity pulls the oceans to make the tides.  Mr Ring says that when the moon is closer to the earth it exerts a stronger pull so it can move the earth’s crust.  That’s pretty good going as the crust is pretty thick, and gravity is very weak.  Gravity is weaker than me as I can lift my leg off the ground and it doesn’t take much effort at all.  To think that something weaker than me lifting my leg can shift an entire tectonic plate underlying New Zealand is quite ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(52%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>children quake 4 christchurch night family back love feel christmas quakes year bed 5 birthday 6 earth world today sleep</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people christchurch city earthquake time ve day good things life work earthquakes buildings february place september lot damage 2011 months</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>home back house didn thought shaking door car quake floor day time school earthquake felt people hit family ground started</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>water home house back road day power work time drive 3 damage city hours morning made car traffic days christchurch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people lyttelton earthquake things house thing bit community stuff didn good back interview thought don fire put bettina lot feel</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>building street people collapsed road square park desk car phone back buildings asked office rubble point walking made floor told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>pain god things hospital time good made back don car injury road lord scott nurses day spinal walk helped put</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>normal water silt truck quake chimney roads big hole buildings road quakes high bricks sand houses st wall walls men</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>home insurance builder land house manager neighbour 2 homes fence project asked insurer repair site company property claims 3 builders</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>building jo mayor earthquake time bob team gallery art city ann teams civic council task latimer block staff found canterbury</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
