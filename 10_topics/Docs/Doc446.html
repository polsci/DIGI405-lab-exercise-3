Remember that song the Beetle’s sang “Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away”. We cannot look back to the past and relive it; we must apply the present to help for the future. This was to be a new year a new beginning and as I sat in my prayer closet just talking to the Father, (God) he spoke clearly to me in 2008 in an audible voice, and said “I want you to be a conduit for me” and when I looked up the word “Conduit” it said a pipe which allows things to pass through it.
I pondered on this word for some days until it finally sank into my spirit. 
I realized that what God says to me must be spoken out to others to encourage and bless and admonish if necessary. I loved the fact that God and I spoke often to one another in the early hours.

Then came the voice of the Lord through the gentle breeze. “…Your pain is the same as that of anyone who is called to be a prophet. 

Though fruitless, you are to convey my messages to the people. Because that is your call and mission. Life becomes meaningful to the extent you showed commitment to your call. It is not your responsibility to make people convert. You are called to make them aware of the revelations that I give to you.”   I felt so humble to say the least and I just cried and cried for what seemed an hour.
It was confirmed when a dear friend of mine emailed me some days later and said “You know what, you are a conduit”. Thank you for obeying God. The word you gave to me was spot on and I was blessed by it. 
I realized God was saying he wanted to pass on things he was saying to me to others. I was to be a modern day prophet for him. I was not to alter anything whatsoever he spoke and I had to seek him in all things. I had to say it as it was, in Spirit and in truth.
This I have been doing for some years now speaking about what is happening in New Zealand and around the world and giving words of knowledge when applicable. Sometimes when I prophesy over people I get a burden and cry. They call me the weeping prophet at times. I feel so humble and honoured to be chosen to do this and even today when I am in his presence I am in awe and overwhelmed.
MRI Scan.

So some years later truly retired, we are now into 2010 and the fun is about to begin or is it? I had been helping Helen with something in the garden, and my disc in my back decided to give out. I sought help with a surgeon who suggested an MRI scan.
It all happened on the 4th July 2010 while waiting to have an MRI scan at Southern Cross Radiology Bealy Ave, Christchurch. I was in extreme pain after having a disc in my back collapse and all my nerves were crushed. 
As I sat in the waiting room it got worse compressing the disc, and I could hardly walk, and had to be assisted up onto the MRI table and down again.
The twenty minutes I spent in that machine was agony having to sit still as I could, and with noises going clang, bang, as the machine took photos of my back. They played music through headphones I was wearing so one would feel relaxed, but it was still scary having to go into this long tunnel none the less. (A claustrophobic thing for me.)

Those who had the knowledge and power to say “Off to the Hospital” had diagnosed me wrong. The Radiologist showed me the severity of my Disc collapse pointing out pictures of the damage at my request but chose to say, “You’ll be ok,” and sent me home. My loving daughter Angela helped put me into the car and drove me home.
 I had an injection from my own Doctor on Friday afternoon, but it did not alter the pain at all it just got worse by the minute. 
She knew of my condition since I had been her patient for twenty odd years and I suppose she should have sent me off to the hospital too but did not. Within just a few hours later I was rushed to A&E dept. Christchurch Hospital for urgent surgery as I had become paralyzed from the waist down.  I was beside myself.
 The Ambulance staff carried me out from my bed late Saturday night to the Ambulance outside. 
I felt every bump in the road on the journey to the hospital. It was agony, but the ambulance men were very good at their job calming me down as much as possible. I was in a mess to say the least.
I had to endure being there at A&E lying flat on my back Saturday night & Sunday morning right through to the operation at approximately 10 am Sunday. I was in excruciating pain watching others who were just drunk and a young girl who slit her wrists because she wasn’t getting attention fast enough. This in turn took the Dr’s away from me. I could not believe the slackness of things in the department.
So many people coming in (Mainly elderly) and those who even in the early hrs of the morning had been in accidents. It took my mind off things for a moment or two.
My wife was at my side and also my Daughters, Angela, and Sophia, which was lovely to see as they kept me calm by talking just about everything. What a blessing they were to me.
I had an ECG, and Pic line inserted with injections going in to try and lower the pain level, which helped only slightly. They said I would have to have an x-ray because my heart was not functioning properly.
 (I had Atrial Fibrillation) showing the bottom of the heart working but not the top working as well as could be. Something to do with the narrowing of an artery in my chest. They said we might put in a stent, whatever that was?
 It skipped a beat every four beats and sent blood rushing to my head. Sometimes it made me light headed. It was strange hearing your heart beat audible it seemed so loud and caused anxiety in me.
After being wheeled into the x-ray room by this young attendant, and being bumped around going through doorways (and I felt every one) they said that I had to sit up and I thought, “You got to be joking me! “ I cannot do that without assistance I told her I wasn’t able to sit up by myself. Why can’t they just slide the board under me?  It just did not make sense? These nurses seemed to be in training by my reasoning, as they weren’t professional in my books at all.
I was made to sit up to a 90 degree angle with their assistance, and as they pushed just that little bit more I felt something in my back snap and the pain was greater than the first. 
The young nurses had snapped two bones off my disc or spine? By their actions, and I was in extreme agony. 
I don’t think apologies were made I cannot quite remember, and I finally was wheeled into the surgery room after getting the appropriate injections. I came out of surgery and the first thing the surgeon said was Quote “It was the largest disc I have ever seen, and I removed two other bones that had broken off as well. The disc blew out of your back and hit me on the chest” Unquote. 
“Can I show this large disc to the medical school here? The surgeon said. I told him that’s fine go for it.
I spent 5 days in ICU and then transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital for about three weeks, and then onto Ward 28 Public Hospital. I went on this wonderful bed which had all the mod cons fitted but as I was wheeled past the reception part of the ward, the nurse in charge said in a loud voice.
 “Oh! No! You can’t have that bed in here.” I hoped she was only joking, but she was not and I had to have a standard bed which seemed to be hard as nails. 
God moves in Mysterious ways!

It was here that God spoke to me in a vision that I would be ministering to people and speaking about His Love, and that I would be an encouragement to those in similar circumstances at Burwood Spinal Unit. I was blown away when I found myself doing just that at Public Hospital.
 I had spoken to and encouraged 7 people and even gave a prophetic word to someone whom I did not know at all, but he accepted the word given with thanks and asked if he could keep it.
He was the top criminologist in NZ (Professor Greg Newbold) and I even named him by name (Word of knowledge) before knowing who he was.  Isn’t God good!
The only sad part of things was when I realized my older brother Desmond had died in that same ward just across the way and I was the last person he saw alive and after greeting him he opened his eyes and died.
 How he ended up there was a story in itself which for one reason or another I cannot go into here, but he needed not to have died at all had he been given the care needed in his circumstance by others in the Rest Home he was at. Somehow it all added to my trauma of things and often I would reflect on it. He died far too early poor fellow.

Earthquakes, and things.
Finally I was taken by ambulance to Burwood Spinal Unit where I was to be for about five months. Not in my wildest dreams did I think I would be there that long. It was here that my story starts regarding Earthquakes and things. 
They had wheeled me into a room, just across from the nurses’ station, and before long the nurses brought someone else in so I had someone to talk to. He appeared to be a small man, (Roger by name) but then after talking to him I realized that this man they brought in had been run over by a train and it happened because he slipped on new paint on the platform as it had been raining.  He had been rushing to catch this train.
 The doors were locked on the train and he could not get on. He fell under the moving train and ended up with just one small left limb, no legs or hands, and no right limb at all. I don’t know how he survived. He did not seem to know who he was and his story was in the papers across New Zealand. “Who is this man? The story read. No one seemed to know much about him at all.
My roommate Roger was a hive of information. Talk about an encyclopaedia! He knew it all, I mean I would talk about Johnny Cash and out would come everything about his marriage, his background, what he sang and so forth. Yet he said he did not read much and occasionally he went to the library.
I was born and bred with music in my bones since the age of five, but I only knew half of this man’s knowledge of things.
I felt sorry for old Roger who was so likable and wondered how he would fear down the track, but the staff seemed to have a handle on things. I spoke to the head nurse Anna who came to help me and said to her, “He must be the worst case here in this ward, and to my surprise she said “No! You are”. I was astounded.
I couldn’t believe what I was hearing anyway as time went by the nurses changed me as I had lost Bladder and Bowel control which had to be attended to daily three or four times & injections every four hrs for infections that had taken place. (Chest, Bladder, Stomach, and I felt feverish and was shaking and had pneumonia. I was in a bad way.

I didn’t know in the thick of things I would experience a Quake as large as 7.1 Magnitude, and when it struck, my bed moved sideways a foot here and there with tremendous force, and as I could only see the ceiling I watched in horror as it all moved back and forth. I hung onto the rails of the bed and wondered where to now? 
There was nothing I could do at all but lay there, and I just yelled to my roommate, “Are you Ok! He replied in a quiver, “Yeah I think so.” He wasn’t with it. I told him to Trust God!
 It was all I could do. I thought I was going to be thrown onto the floor. It was terrifying.  I felt the whole place was going to crash down around my ears. It was a deafening noise with the ceiling creaking and groaning and making ungodly noises. I guess fear and anxiety kicked in quite a bit but I tried to stay strong for Rogers’s sake as he seemed quite shaken having no arms and legs at all.
The nurses came scurrying in and asked if we were ok! and after assurances they left, but before they left I said in an anxious voice, “How are we going to get out of here? They replied, “Through the sliding door,” we will take you onto the grass outside. 
Sure I thought to myself, and if the door was jammed or something they would’t fit us all into the hallway as there were far too many patients, but they were lovely and efficient and calmed us down one by one. 
No- body knew of the trauma, the anguish and anxiety I felt over the months following, the hopelessness I felt not being able to walk or do normal things. The loss of bladder and bowel was as upsetting for me as staff had to do these things for me and I had to get over the embarrassment of it all. I had been such an active person getting about and helping others less fortunate than me. I really felt like a useless old sod.
I got so angry at God first, telling him that I had done all these marvellous things for him and had showed his love to so many, why did he allow this to happen to me? Then I fought the shock and trauma etc., until finally succumbing to acceptance of how I was to be. I had to forget things and get on with life, and so I kicked the negative out and got into a positive mode.
The aftershocks were terrible, and added to the fear and anxiety I was feeling. All I could do was stare at the ceiling hoping another quake wasn’t going to come. I hid this fear inside away from my visitors and wife.

 Every time I went to physiotherapy or elsewhere I was very sensitive about these quakes and kept wondering when the next would come. I felt every shudder or vibration in my wheel chair or bed.

I had to go through so much with humiliation in the days following after soiling myself and wetting the bed because I had no control over my body (Bladder and Bowel.) particularly. The aftershocks certainly did not help and I felt terrified by them.
 I would wake up in the early hours with pyjama’s soaking wet from stress and have to have them changed by the late night nurses who were much older than the day time ones.
The nurses were great but some stayed in their little squares they built for themselves so to speak while others moved out of the square and really helped. These ones were a blessing to me.
 It’s easy to read about pain and help people with pain, but to experience it yourself is a different story. You have to walk in the patient’s shoes for an hour or two. But they mean well.
Maria, the Clinical nurse specialist was of extreme help to me. She often gave me sound advice on things and boy she knew how to council people with pain and things. I made a great recovery because of her input. She was so nice to talk with about things and mature. It was so sad to hear about the death in her family I felt her grieving. 

I knew them all by name and it was a pleasure talking to them as they came every few hours to check and change things like the bed and my pj’s.
 They helped in my recovery so much with early Rehab, Physio, and things like that. There was Tessa, she was a blessing, so much energy always smiling and willing to do anything for you, Lena was much like Tessa and helped a lot, and Kate, Jess, Kathy, Kelly, Christine, Angela, Anna, Paul, and Nathan the manager to name a few. All good nurses.

(Raj) B. Singhal, the head Doctor of the unit was absolutely marvelous as well and understanding. He knew my limitations and was positive in speaking to me, which in turn made me that way too! Dr A. Anthony was as well and was exceptional in his field of knowledge of the bladder.
Then there was Rosie the receptionist who always spoke with politeness, and helped with anything I asked for, she made me feel welcome. The Physio girls were great too especially the one from the UK, who went by the name of Kelly Robinson.

Joke:
 Kelly pushed me pass my limit and got me on my feet much quicker. I used to tell her Irish jokes like this one. “This Irish man went to town sightseeing, and while looking around the city he found he needed to go to the toilet. 
He couldn’t seem to find one and lo and behold came across this large church and said to himself “There has to be one in there! 
He swung open the doors and as he looked down the aisle, there at the end he saw these two boxes. 
He did not know that they were confessional boxes and that the priest was in one waiting for someone to come for confession.
He dashed inside the left one and heard this person next-door going “Ahem” (The priest was trying to get his attention.) Again he heard “Ahem”, but in a louder volume. Finally the priest banged on the wall to get this guy’s attention, and the Irishman said back, “Hey it’s no good banging on my wall; I’ve got no paper in here either. Ha! Ha!

I achieved so much in the Gym that they presented me with a certificate. I had to climb six steps to get it from Kelly. I was so pleased I had achieved so much with their help. Annie the head girl was tremendous too, so helpful.(But I’m getting ahead of myself).

I thought I was handling things quite well with progressing a little here and there. The shock was when the Head surgeon had said,                               “You will never walk again”.
 I don’t know if the quake was worse or what he said about walking.  It hit me hard and I withdrew into myself. The aftershocks never let up and made me nervous.
As a Christian of some forty odd years, (51 actually), I rebuked those words the Surgeon said, and set about doing what I could in the gym and exercising when I could. Whatever they asked me to do I did twice as much.
I would pray every night “Father make me whole again let your healing anointing flow over me and heal my body. Let restoration come. 

I never let up day and night praying pestering the Lord. As each day came and went, changes came and out of the blue while watching a game of the All Blacks with my son in law Rick, my toes began to wiggle on my right foot. The game became second as Joy and Exhilaration took place. I was over the moon and as the weeks and months ticked by my prayers changed from asking to thanking him.

“Father, Thank you for the Restoration and Healings upon my body.” Thank you for hearing my cries, and for answering my prayers. I Love you.
I met one of the Crusaders Nasi Manu, and his manager who gave me a signed poster, and even spoke with John Key the prime minister who visited the Hospital. When John came over to my bed I made sure I said about the elderly, that they needed a pay rise. I hope he took me seriously. He seemed nice to talk with and sincere.
Somewhere down the track, and after much Physio and hard work in Rehab I thought I was now ready to get out onto the road and go home, but I still had to endure the last month in a place called TR (Traditional Rehab).
 It was here that they put you through your paces and taught you everything you needed to know about life as a disabled person. Travis and Fiona were just great people who spent time helping us.
 They gave good advice about pacing ourselves with positive thoughts about do’s and don’ts.
We learnt things like cooking, and cleaning, and washing dishes, preparing meals for others once a week.
 (I had to cook for seven people and I seemed to cope ok!)  And even hanging clothes on the line.
I even tried playing pool with two nurses behind me in case I fell, and fall I did at one time luckily not causing any damage as I had no feeling in one of my legs. It was so easy to break a leg. They taught us how to pace ourselves which was good stuff.
It made me laugh when I could not move and after some time the nurse Kelly (the one from UK,) came over and said to me “Lawry you’re standing on your foot”. I could have been embarrassed but I wasn’t.

Yet they did not put you down for your mistakes but lovingly looked after you. Today I always laugh about that episode.  
While learning how to walk in the Gym with a walking frame this ball was in my way and I tried kicking it away but I used my wrong foot and almost fell. Thank goodness my instructor Kelly who was always with me saw the event, and was there to steady me. 
I guess I got over confident at times. I was like that always doing double what they said. Another time while doing exercises on my back I kept looking at the ceiling, and I spotted the loose boards above me, and saw cracks but was assured by Kelly that they were fixed and ok.

Once a week we went out to get groceries with one of the staff always at our side in case we stumbled or got into difficulty. I could not get up the gentle slope going into the shop, and finally with effort made it. Travis was ahead of me and did not see me still outside trying to get up the slope I’m sure he would have helped me had he known. 
Travis and I played pool often in my spare time, and we challenged each other with moves. Most of the time he won but occasionally I did too!  Go Travis! He was a good guy to talk to and had some good positive things to say, always on the go helping here and there. I admire him. I eventually was able to play mini golf in my wheelchair as a final rehab thing, and to my surprise got two holes...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(65%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>pain god things hospital time good made back don car injury road lord scott nurses day spinal walk helped put</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people christchurch city earthquake time ve day good things life work earthquakes buildings february place september lot damage 2011 months</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>home back house didn thought shaking door car quake floor day time school earthquake felt people hit family ground started</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>water home house back road day power work time drive 3 damage city hours morning made car traffic days christchurch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>building street people collapsed road square park desk car phone back buildings asked office rubble point walking made floor told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people lyttelton earthquake things house thing bit community stuff didn good back interview thought don fire put bettina lot feel</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>children quake 4 christchurch night family back love feel christmas quakes year bed 5 birthday 6 earth world today sleep</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>normal water silt truck quake chimney roads big hole buildings road quakes high bricks sand houses st wall walls men</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>home insurance builder land house manager neighbour 2 homes fence project asked insurer repair site company property claims 3 builders</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>building jo mayor earthquake time bob team gallery art city ann teams civic council task latimer block staff found canterbury</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
