He hōnore, he korōria

INTRODUCTION 
There are two quotes which in effect sets the context for the contribution I am about to make. The first is taken from my ancestor Tāwhiao when he said; 
“Ki te kotahi te kākaho ka whati, ki te kāpuia, e kore e whati” 
“When a reed stands alone it can easily break, but when bound together it is unbreakable” 
The metaphor speaks to a collective endeavour, or collectivism as a foundation for well-being. The kākaho is the stem of the toetoe used in times of old for purposes such as lining for whare or thatching. The imagery of transforming what would otherwise be a humble rākau through purposeful utilisation reinforces the message of transforming wellbeing. 
The other quote is from one of my favourite poets Maya Angelou who reflected; 
“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel” 
The notion of well-being while traditionally measured through a range of indicators at its very core, well-being is a measure that innate and personal to what one values or feels should be valued according to their context and world view.  
The conversation you have been invited to join challenges us to consider a different context from which we might reset our compass about what is important, really important to transform lives and the way we act towards a future that is determined to measure prosperity in a very different way. 
As Minister for Local Government and Māori Development, there are some synergies that bring this conversation together even though the context and starting points are at very different places. 
Take Local Government a sector defined by statute with roles and functions mandated by Government with very little capability to deliver to Māori aspiration beyond a mandate of community defined priorities and services or treaty mandated processes. 
And then there is Māori Development which is underpinned by a world view founded in cultural norms, customs and practices, defined by language and mātauranga māori. 
But both portfolios intersect when we start to envisage how we might set our sails and steer towards intergenerational wellbeing as a nation. 
As a policy framework, the Living Standards Framework is attempting to do something courageous and really important. It is trying to break out and look beyond GDP as the measure of our national wellbeing. If we can achieve this (and I believe we can) we will begin to feel that our nation is different because finally we know who we are and what really matters. The emphasis on the four capitals enable a more holistic approach considering wellbeing and prosperity. 
The Living Standards Framework should represent the values and aspirations of our country and in my view the living embodiment of what the Treaty of Waitangi envisaged for all citizens and Māori as indigenous peoples in particular. The indigenous component of the framework has real potential to shift the type of conversation that policy makers can lead towards a long-term vision, prioritising investment, committing to integrated solutions and focusing on outcomes that improve ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(46%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(41%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(2%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(2%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
