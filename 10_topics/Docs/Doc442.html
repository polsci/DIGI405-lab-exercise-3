When seeing a call for Christchurch residents to record their earthquake experience I sat down and knocked up a few notes. By the time I had finished I had 14 A4 pages of notes and photographs. Too much to cover in the space available on this site.
The main reason I recorded my experience is because I had – as stated on the cover of the booklet – ‘Some positive memories of the Christchurch earthquakes in contrast to the stress and trauma of many recorded stories’.
A copy of the booklet has been registered with the National Library Service as follows:

Published by T D Kerr P O Box 12 043 Christchurch 8242.
