I dreamt a noise.  A low hum, a rumble.  

I sat bolt upright in bed and yelled “It’s a big one!”  

The floor began to vibrate.  I felt as if I was standing on a plucked violin string.   The sound of smashing bricks, shattering glass, thunder, grinding rock, shouting earth was travelling towards us, fast.  

I leapt up and ran for the doorway.  It was dark, but light enough to see.  I held the door jamb with both hands.  The floor breathed in.  It moved like a giant arc rising under my feet.

The sound hit, the floor jackhammered.  The door jamb slammed back and forth.  I swear it moved 5cm.  Where was Terry?  

“What are you doing?” I yelled, straining to hear myself above the noise.

Terry stumbled around the bed losing his balance.  He made it to the door.  

He put his mouth close to my ear “Couldn’t walk”. 

“When you can, fill the bath and I’ll meet you back here” I said.  “The pipes will probably break soon”.

“Where are you going?” Terry asked.

“To get Matt”.  Matt was 14 years old.

I would probably get 20 seconds between shakes to run down the hall to Matt’s room.  I breathed in.  One, two, three.  Breathed out, slower. One, two, three, four five. My heart was thumping.  I had to wait.  Could I make it to 10?  The shaking was slowing.  Should I go now?

I ran.  Too soon.  The floor of the hall came up to meet my feet.  In the dark it was hard to keep my balance.  I bounced off the walls but made it down the hall.  Matt was in bed.  His model planes were swinging wildly on the ceiling, and he was looking at them, trying to figure out what was going on.  I sat on his bed.

“Hallo sweetheart” I said.  My breath eased.  He was fine.  

Between a gap in the curtain, we watched the chimney next door tumble down.  Bricks bounced, denting their iron roof, cascading over the fence, on to our driveway, gouging holes in the tarseal.  

“Grab your dressing gown, and we’ll wait in the dining room door for our chimney to fall down” I said.  Nothing had happened, we were fine.

Matt’s room was small, and the steel roof light.  There was not much to fall on him, but we had practiced all getting under the large dining room table during an earthquake.  After all, this could be the fore-runner of a much larger quake.  The Alpine Fault was predicted to move up to a magnitude 9.  If it did, our concrete tile roof – a tonne about our head – could shake apart, and come through the steel roof above his room.  

Matt got up, stood in the bedroom door frame with me, and when the shocks subsided, lurched down the hall towards the dining room.  Terry was still running the bath water.  Glass smashed as the picture on the mantelpiece fell. Dammit.

“I need my slippers” I said.

“I’ll get the torches, too” he said.  

Our chimney hit the brick porch with a thud.  The whole house jumped.  

“That was lucky” I told Matt “the chimney could have coming through the roof”.

“Slippers.  Here.” said Terry.

“We’ll need a duvet too, and the radio”. I said, holding Matt. “Right, under the table!”

We ran and sat under the dining room table.  Terry headed back into the bedroom and brought us the duvet and radio.  

“The water has stopped” he said “but the bath is full”.

“What do we do now?” said Matt.

“Keep warm and wait ‘til the shocks stop.  It’ll only be ten minutes or so”.  I held him tight.  

In the dark, under the dining room table, we sat wrapped in a duvet.

“All I could think about was you” I told him.  

Another shake hit, and our standing lamp wobbled.  I reached to steady it.  The glass shattered on the floor.  

“Bother, missed!” I hugged Matt tight. “Terry, are you coming under the table?” Terry slid under with us. 

“Cut my finger” he said “had to get a plaster”.  

He sat behind me, hugging me and Matt.  

It seemed an age, in the dark, for the shocks to subside.  Adrenalin surged through us.  Our hearts were beating fast.  Every instinct told us to run, but we stayed put.  Eventually the shakes subsided.

“I’m going to clear up the glass” Terry said.  He slid out, got the broom and swept the floor.  “You can probably come out now”.

We sat on the couch and turned on the radio.  My hands and legs were trembling and my heart was pounding.  We hugged again and waited for the morning light to come.

“Won’t we be best under the table?” asked Matt.  

“We should be alright, hon.  That’ll be the worst one, and we’re OK.  The next shocks won’t be as big, but there will be lots of them” I said.  “There’s nothing to fall on us here.  Besides we can always go back under the table later.  We’ll stay close to it”.
Radio New Zealand announced there was a quake, and that they were waiting for official advice.  The Beach Boys song “Good vibrations” played.  We looked at each other and started to laugh.  The song was abruptly stopped. 

The sheepish announcer said “You are now listening to a reporter in the initial stages of losing his job”.  

We laughed some more.  

News of the quake began as a trickle.   The interviewers asked officials at Civil Defence lots of questions.  What is the damage? Has anyone been killed?  The patient Civil Defence man stated the obvious.  People were in bed at home and not at work.  It was dark.  The power was out. That made it hard to see.  When the sun came up, there would be some light.  That would make it easier to see.  Dawn was a few hour...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(43%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>home back house didn thought shaking door car quake floor day time school earthquake felt people hit family ground started</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(29%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>normal water silt truck quake chimney roads big hole buildings road quakes high bricks sand houses st wall walls men</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>water home house back road day power work time drive 3 damage city hours morning made car traffic days christchurch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people lyttelton earthquake things house thing bit community stuff didn good back interview thought don fire put bettina lot feel</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(2%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people christchurch city earthquake time ve day good things life work earthquakes buildings february place september lot damage 2011 months</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(2%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>building street people collapsed road square park desk car phone back buildings asked office rubble point walking made floor told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>home insurance builder land house manager neighbour 2 homes fence project asked insurer repair site company property claims 3 builders</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>children quake 4 christchurch night family back love feel christmas quakes year bed 5 birthday 6 earth world today sleep</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>pain god things hospital time good made back don car injury road lord scott nurses day spinal walk helped put</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>building jo mayor earthquake time bob team gallery art city ann teams civic council task latimer block staff found canterbury</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
