I understand many of you are keen to hear what this portfolio’s all about. I think that kōrero is also relevant to the kaupapa you’re all here to discuss over the next couple of days, so I’ll start there. 
The creation of the portfolio signals the Government’s focus on opportunities for partnerships and better engagement between the Crown and Māori on matters of mutual interest.
To achieve this focus, the government has approved the following initial priorities for the Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti:
ensure the Crown meets its Treaty obligations;
develop a new engagement model and guidelines for the Government and public sector;
co-design partnerships, principles and frameworks to ensure that agencies generate the best solutions to issues affecting Māori;
ensure public sector capability is strengthened across the board;
provide a cross Government view on the health of the Māori Crown partnerships; 
provide strategic leadership on contemporary Treaty issues;
other matters including the constitutional and institutional arrangements supporting partnerships between the Crown and Māori: and
continue to take the lead in organising significant Māori and Crown events, ie Waitangi Day. 
 As Minister, I see these priorities as a means to improve the Māori Crown relationship by doing things differently and not repeating the mistakes of the past.
 Those mistakes include instances where governments decided they knew what was best for Māori, sat in Wellington and wrote up a strategy, then went out to whānau, hapū, and iwi and told them what the government had decided will be in their best interests. 
That approach has never worked. So I took the time to travel around the motu and ask what we needed to do to strengthen the relationship, and what my priorities as Minister should be. 
There was a lot of interest and enthusiasm to give me answers to those questions. 
The hui ran from March to June. I held 20 public hui and 11 focus groups attended by over 1600 people, and received around 230 written submissions.
Some of you may have even participated in that process. 
The overwhelming theme emerging from that engagement was that Māori desire a closer relationship with the Crown – one of partnership.
This doesn’t mean shared governance. The Crown is still the Crown and its obligations are unchanged. 
To me partnership simply implies shared responsibility by the Crown bringing its support to the table, and Māori their motivation.
I have now finalised the scope of the portfolio based on what I heard, and happy that this has recently been confirmed by Cabinet.
Cabinet has also agreed to establish an agency to oversee Government’s work with Māori in a post-settlement era.The agency, to be called the Office for Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti, will help facilitate the next step in the Treaty relationship – moving beyond the settlement of Treaty grievances into what it means to work together in partnerships. The name reflects feedback from the hui that Māori should appear first in the relationship.
