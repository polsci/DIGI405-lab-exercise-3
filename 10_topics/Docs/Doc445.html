My name is Godfrey Nosa, I was working across the road from the CTV building working on the St Pauls Presbyterian church.
I remember going to lunch in our shipping container about 12.30 pm and at 12.51 pm the quake struck sending the church down, straight after we ran out the front and witnessed the CTV come down..
It was so horrific and scary and a moment I will never forget.
Myself and Evan a work colleague ran over on top of the rubble and started helping pull people out, amongst them was robin Malcolm’s mother.. We were one of the first on the destroyed building and we pulled about 8-9 people out alive..
I never speak of this and don’t know why now, I met some very heroic people that day.
In case your wondering I was wearing the green hard hat red top and black shorts…

God bless the people we lost and couldn’t get to and much love to everyone affected by it….
