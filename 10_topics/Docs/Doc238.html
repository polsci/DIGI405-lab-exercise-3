TALKING POINTS 
Tourism: Tourism is our country’s biggest export industry, contributing 21 percent of New Zealand’s foreign exchange earnings – earning around $34 billion to the country’s economy every year. [1]
Our tourism industry, directly and indirectly employs 14.5 percent of our workforce in Aotearoa. 
While it is hard to ring-fence the economic value of Māori tourism we do know there are some indigenous rock-stars in the industry and plenty of scope for Māori tourism to grow.
A recent report showed that while we welcome three-million tourists to our shores every year only 54% of them report have had a unique Māori experience. 
Tourism as a way to tell our own stories: Tourism ventures owned and operated by Māori are a powerful means of rangatiratanga. They enable Māori to tell their own stories in their own way and on their own terms to ensure authenticity and accuracy in how Māori stories are conveyed.
An example of this is Te Puia and the New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute in Rotorua. I was honored to be present when the New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute Vesting Bill had its first reading in Parliament in December last year.
This Bill will see the Te Whakarewarewa Thermal Valley Lands be removed from the Te Pūmautanga o Te Arawa Treaty Settlement legislation and, together with the assets and liabilities of NZMACI, will be vested in the Te Puia NZMACI Limited Partnership under the kaitiakitanga of Ngāti Whakaue and Tūhourangi Ngāti Wahiao.
Sir Apirana Ngata established NZMACI’s predecessor, Te Ao Mārama, as a way of preserving mātauranga-ā-iwi, which paved the way for the future establishment of NZMACI as a national institute for the development of Māori arts and crafts. The pairing of tourism with cultural development at NZMACI has played a big part in enabling Māori culture and Māori identity to flourish and find new forms of expression.
Te Puia has helped change the way Māori arts and crafts are viewed and this has had far-reaching benefits for our tourism industry and trading markets. It has also had an impact on the way Aotearoa is seen internationally. So Te Puia and NZMACI are great examples of how Māori can take control of telling their own story in their own way.
 
Regional / Community development and whānau enterprise: Tourism in particular provides great opportunities for regional and community development. Tourism ventures in the regions provide employment opportunities for local communities, help to retain young talent in the regions and contribute to local economies.
It also provides an opportunity for tourists to get off the beaten tourist track into the regions to get a taste of regional grassroots New Zealand and to connect with our whānau, hapū and iwi communities on a more personal level. In a day where discerning international visitors are seeking more of a personal touch, this presents opportunities for our Māori tourism providers to be innovative and creative in their approach.
We all know that provincial New Zealand is the economic engine room of Aotearoa. Much of New Zealand’s economy rests on the success of the regions, with tourism, forestry and the primary industries all contributing to New Zealand’s export economy. However, some regions are challenged with higher unemployment, lower productivity, difficulty finding skilled workers and poverty.
Despite these challenges, the Government is keen to ensure that people living all over New Zealand can reach their full potential by helping to build a regional economy that is sustainable, inclusive and productive. For this purpose, the Government has allocated three billion dollars over a three-year term to invest in regional economic development through the Provincial Growth Fund.
Its priorities are to enhance economic development opportunities, create sustainable jobs, enable Māori to reach their full potential, boost social inclusion and participation, build resilient communities, and help meet New Zealand’s climate change targets. I encourage you to get in touch with MBIE to discuss how the Provincial Growth Fund might be able to assist you in developing your tourism business.
The importance of collaboration: I would also like to highlight the importance of collaboration in order to realise cultural tourism opportunities. We want visitors to leave New Zealand having had a great experience so that they can tell others about their time in New Zealand. In order to achieve this, we need to work together with all relevant stakeholders including iwi, councils, whānau, businesses and tertiary and training institutes.
