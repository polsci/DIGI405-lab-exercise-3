I have been wondering when will I be ever free from this pain that constantly surrounds me and have to rely on others to help me through my ordeals?

I had engaged a lawyer who said they were  or had been through what I had been through and could help me. I put my trust in this person and told them all of my private things  and the trauma, pain etc anxiety, depression I had faced during the quake  which was 7.1 and 6.3.

The lawyer advised me that they would take my case to ACC and although they were good we lost the case and it was said of me that “It was just old age that caused me to have slipped a large disc and shatter my nerves. 

I was extremely angry that they could do this to me after all they said it was Medical misadventure and I was suffering quite badly .

there were so many things I wanted to do but couldn’t because of the condition I was in.

twice I had been on the phone to the authorities and they were sympathetic towards me but that is where it  ended.

I had to back away and let God handle it and night and day we prayed that all that the Locust had eaten would be restored back to me.

I decided to take my case further after being assured we will win, so I went to court with it and after much haggling they left me in limbo. My lawyer fought on and the Judge had said in no uncertain terms that the case had gone on too long and needed to be finalised.

More Dr,s involved, and surgeons arguing over whether I was paralysed or not!

Again I had to taught to the powers in charge of my case and they told me  that they would ring me if any change.
I would say this in all that is within me, DONT GIVE UP. After 5 yrs of going here and there I got a phone call to say they were wrong and I WON MY CASE FROM ACC. I was to be covered by them going back even further than when I became paralysed and on top of that I could get a Lump sum pay-out as well.
So again I say if you have a case going with ACC hang in there and push through the battle lines. Don’t be bullied into a corner and told you can’t win for mighty will be the fall if you battle on.

I would not like to go through the 7.1 and the 6.3 ever again, and thank God his love towards us is everlasting.
