I’m sure everyone in this room agrees. Valued throughout the ages, creativity is arguably most needed at our present point in history. In this technology-rich era, accessing knowledge is no longer the key priority – rather it is the imagination and the innovation we bring to that knowledge, and our ability to have a vision for the future which counts.

As a country we need creative minds and creative industries in order to flourish at both national and global levels – and that’s why, to borrow WeCreate’s hashtag - #nzcreativitymatters.

I consider it an absolute privilege to hold the Arts, Culture and Heritage portfolio – it means I get to work with a sector that makes a truly significant contribution to New Zealanders’ wellbeing, identity and economy. I also get to hear and learn from leaders such as yourselves – people who are both the heart and the engines of the industry.

My vision for Aotearoa’s cultural and creative sector is quite simple - that all New Zealanders can access a range of cultural experiences meaningful to them and that the sector is valued and supported to enable creative industries to grow and creative people to thrive.

All of you here today, and the industries and organisations you represent, play a vital role in making this happen.

There are three reasons why culture and creativity are central to Government’s reform agenda:

our culture is an inseparable and integral expression of our humanity, and creativity - our ability to think and operate outside of the proverbial box - is what separates us from algorithms and machines
	our arts and culture are valuable and positive enhancers of our physical, mental and social well-being
	our fast-growing and high exporting creative industries make a significant contribution to our economy - they drive employment and help us to share ‘Brand NZ’ - Aotearoa’s unique perspective with the world.
The impact and reach of our creative industries and people is immense.

When I think of the impact of creativity in New Zealand, what first comes to my mind are the numerous ways cultural experiences bring us together and enhance our daily lives – be it a school group touring Te Papa’s Te Marae for the first time, the 1,000 events of New Zealand Music Month or an art therapy group at a local rest home.

Added to this is the financial impact of the creative sector. In 2017, NZIER calculated that the sector cumulatively contributed a massive $17.5 billion to New Zealand’s GDP – including both the creative industries and creative input to general business activity.

It is important to consider what this means in people terms, and employment-wise this equates to over 130,000 jobs. That’s more than 6 percent of our workforce involved in creative activity – either as creatives in the industry, in roles supporting creative industries and people who bring their creativity to industries traditionally categorised as non-creative.

As impressive as these figures are, there will always be room for these industries to grow – for as Sir Richard (Taylor) very astutely said in his video message earlier today – “creativity is an infinite resource”.

‘Createch’ – the intersection and convergence of creativity and technology – is a rapidly developing field, and I understand the two Createch events hosted by WeCreate earlier this year were productive in identifying future opportunities in this space.

We know that our future economy will be built on creativity and technology.

It is imperative therefore that creativity is front of mind as we consider the future of work, and the workforce of the future.

In order to ensure the next generation is resilient to increased future automation we need to maximise the development of those ‘soft’ skills which are so often the defining features of creative roles – including cognitive ability, innovative problem-solving and interpersonal and systems skills.

Providing our children with a well-rounded education that fosters imaginative thinking will help prepare them for success and will future-proof our workforce.

There is clearly great rationale for focusing on culture and the creative industries – however I ultimately want us to move beyond the space of having to justify their economic value or intrinsic worth.

In order to reach a future environment where culture’s value is embedded in the ecosystem of daily life, we are taking a broad view and acting across all levels of Government.

I’d like to zoom out for a moment to look at some of our ‘big picture’ work which will impact the creative industry.

Across Government we are taking a holistic approach to how we can best improve New Zealanders’ overall living standards and wellbeing. By putting wellbeing at the core of our policies, we can transform how creativity is valued and incorporated.

We have a Bill in progress that will reinsert the four ‘well-beings’ into the Local Government Act – restoring the purpose of local government to be the promotion of ‘the social, economic, environmental and cultural well-being of communities’. This move has the potential to positively impact the daily lives of New Zealanders across the country – whether through free concerts and outdoor activities, or improved library services and new arts initiatives...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(46%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(32%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
