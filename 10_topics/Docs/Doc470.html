Eight more large quakes over magnitude 5 hit on the same day, followed by hundreds of aftershocks.  We felt lucky.  The Southern Alps fault where the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates collide could have ruptured.  It didn’t.   No one was injured.  We lost a chimney.  We had a narrow escape.  
On 22 February 2011, at 12:51pm a 6.3 earthquake 6km away and 6km deep hit Christchurch with a force of 2.2 G’s.  One G is the force of gravity.  Gravity is an accelerating force of 10 metres per second per second.  The means every second you travel 10m/s (36km per hour).  When this quake hit, every second, we travelled at a speed of 22 m/s (4,500kph).  Sound travels at 340m/s (1,200 kph).  We were hit by a force four times faster than the speed of sound.
The force was enough to open the earth’s magnetic field.  Weird flickering light – all of the electromagnetic radiation that emits from the sun, but usually bounces off the earth’s magnetic field – shot through the atmosphere.  A daytime aurora.  Christchurch was weightless.  All of the buildings within Christchurch City within an approximate 10km radius of the epicentre lifted up to 1m off the surface of the earth. 
I floated up. 20cm.  Or more.  Just for a moment.  
The magnetic field closed.  The earth rippled and formed metre high waves.  The height of a wave is measured from its midpoint to its crest.  For every metre we were lifted up to the crest of the wave, we passed back down through its midpoint into the 1m trough of the wave.   Over and over we were lifted and dropped a total of 2m as the ocean of earth tumbled moved around us and through us. Stone and bricks and glass and concrete smashed and ground and split again and again.
 A shock wave that travels through earth bumps into particles that slow it down. The closer the particles are, the less the ground moves.  There were lots of space between particles.  People with homes close to the coast on the sand saw 1m high waves of sand travelling towards them.  People with homes on the Port Hills rock heard the rock grinding.  We were about half way between the Port Hills and the coast on an alluvial plain – where rivers flow.  The soil under our home is fine silt and...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(46%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>normal water silt truck quake chimney roads big hole buildings road quakes high bricks sand houses st wall walls men</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people christchurch city earthquake time ve day good things life work earthquakes buildings february place september lot damage 2011 months</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>home back house didn thought shaking door car quake floor day time school earthquake felt people hit family ground started</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>children quake 4 christchurch night family back love feel christmas quakes year bed 5 birthday 6 earth world today sleep</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>home insurance builder land house manager neighbour 2 homes fence project asked insurer repair site company property claims 3 builders</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(4%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>water home house back road day power work time drive 3 damage city hours morning made car traffic days christchurch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>building street people collapsed road square park desk car phone back buildings asked office rubble point walking made floor told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people lyttelton earthquake things house thing bit community stuff didn good back interview thought don fire put bettina lot feel</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>pain god things hospital time good made back don car injury road lord scott nurses day spinal walk helped put</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>building jo mayor earthquake time bob team gallery art city ann teams civic council task latimer block staff found canterbury</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
