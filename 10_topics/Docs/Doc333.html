My name is John Cleaver, I am 83, and I was just at home, in the kitchen actually. I always have a cooked meal at midday and I was just about to put my lunch in the microwave to get it all warmed up and the whole place just shook. It was the end it, I didn’t get my warm lunch, and I thought gosh, that was very inconvenient of the earthquake, if it would have just waited five minutes I would have had a warm meal! So I just stood there and hung onto the bench till everything sort of calmed down. 
But I had quite a lot of crystal, very nice crystal, mainly French in the cupboard there, and that all came down and smashed on the floor.  Apart from that, nothing really happened to the house. All the books fell out of the bookcase downstairs. It was quite interesting really, I felt all right, but I couldn’t have been really because it was a couple of days and I was still looking at that heap of broken glass on the floor and also the books. I just couldn’t do it somehow.
And anyway, my dear grandson Jacob, he came around, just at the right time as he often does, and he cleaned the whole floor up, vaccuumed and taped up the cupboards and did all those sorts of things. I still couldn’t do the books, but the lady from next door came in and she put the books back. I felt all right, you know, but I was still in a certain amount of shock without realising it.   
I can’t remember what I did after the shaking stopped… I had to have a cold lunch…I really can’t think what I did… I think I just treated it as a normal day really. The severe aftershocks don’t worry me very much really, they are very, very similar to what happens at sea really, in rough weather. 
In the next few days I just behaved normally really. I belong to quite a few organisations, there is always paper work to be done, so thats what I probably did.
Immediately after the earthquake a lot of people came around to see whether I was all right and after a few days I think the Red Cross came, checking up on all the elderly, but unfortunately I don’t feel very elderly, but I suppose I am. Yes, so that was all very nice.
I didn’t really feel as if I did as much as I should have done to help other people. I didn’t offer any accommodation, which I could have done really, in hindsight. Perhaps I should have done more things like that. I did deliver a few meals, when the Navy was here cooking all those meals I delivered some of them, so that was something.
My niece rang up from Nelson and said “John, do you want to come up here?’, but I couldn’t. Quite apart from the responsibilities I’ve got, I just didn’t want to be away, I wanted to be here. 
I don’t think I could have happily left, I had a look around at all my buildings, which is the Torpedo Museum, which is in perfect order. I had a look at the [Freemason’s] Lodge, which was further damaged, and started to work on getting that propped up, because we are still hoping to restore it. I also had a look at the [old Lyttelton jail ] cells, and they are perfectly all right. Margaret Copeland put up a display in there and it didn’t even fall over! And as far as the Torpedo Museum...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(47%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people lyttelton earthquake things house thing bit community stuff didn good back interview thought don fire put bettina lot feel</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people christchurch city earthquake time ve day good things life work earthquakes buildings february place september lot damage 2011 months</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>home back house didn thought shaking door car quake floor day time school earthquake felt people hit family ground started</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>water home house back road day power work time drive 3 damage city hours morning made car traffic days christchurch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(2%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>building street people collapsed road square park desk car phone back buildings asked office rubble point walking made floor told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>children quake 4 christchurch night family back love feel christmas quakes year bed 5 birthday 6 earth world today sleep</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>home insurance builder land house manager neighbour 2 homes fence project asked insurer repair site company property claims 3 builders</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>normal water silt truck quake chimney roads big hole buildings road quakes high bricks sand houses st wall walls men</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>pain god things hospital time good made back don car injury road lord scott nurses day spinal walk helped put</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>building jo mayor earthquake time bob team gallery art city ann teams civic council task latimer block staff found canterbury</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
