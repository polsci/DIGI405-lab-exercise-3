It's a new beginning for you as our Speaker, and I congratulate you again, Mr Speaker. It is a new beginning for this Parliament. It's a new beginning for our new members, and I acknowledge Tamati Coffey and Jo Luxton for your wonderful introductory maiden speeches. I am incredibly proud of each and every one of you and, the fact that you will be joining an already incredible of representatives in this House.

But it's so much more than that. It's a new beginning for everyone who hopes to own a home of their own. It's a new beginning for our children. It's a new beginning for our children. It's a new beginning for our education system and for our health system and for our environment. And on this side of the House, it's a new beginning for a coalition Government.

It is a new beginning for this most MMP of Governments, but it is founded in the oldest of ideas in our democracy: that a Government represents the will of the majority of our people. We are committed to respecting that will. It can also be a new beginning for the new Leader of the Opposition.
