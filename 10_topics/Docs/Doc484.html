The earthquakes meant our fences had to be replaced.  Our loss adjuster sends a breakdown of what replacing our fence costs so that we can get permission from our neighbours to rebuild it-they have to pay half.  We can have what we had, or we can both agree to have something better.  Our neighbours are concerned with cost, so we just go with replacing what we had.  They seem pleased we are organising it all.  

I spend a lot of time on the weekends making sure that our neighbours are kept up to date with progress on our fence.  I remind neighbour 1 to dig up any plants that she has on the boundary, as these will likely be damaged.  I inform neighbour 2 when work is likely to start, and she says they will call to discuss fence heights etc.  The landscaper is happy but makes a comment that things seem to be going almost too smoothly.  Boundaries are funny things â€“ neighbours always have different idea...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(67%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>home insurance builder land house manager neighbour 2 homes fence project asked insurer repair site company property claims 3 builders</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people christchurch city earthquake time ve day good things life work earthquakes buildings february place september lot damage 2011 months</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people lyttelton earthquake things house thing bit community stuff didn good back interview thought don fire put bettina lot feel</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>home back house didn thought shaking door car quake floor day time school earthquake felt people hit family ground started</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>water home house back road day power work time drive 3 damage city hours morning made car traffic days christchurch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>pain god things hospital time good made back don car injury road lord scott nurses day spinal walk helped put</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>normal water silt truck quake chimney roads big hole buildings road quakes high bricks sand houses st wall walls men</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>building street people collapsed road square park desk car phone back buildings asked office rubble point walking made floor told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>children quake 4 christchurch night family back love feel christmas quakes year bed 5 birthday 6 earth world today sleep</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>building jo mayor earthquake time bob team gallery art city ann teams civic council task latimer block staff found canterbury</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
