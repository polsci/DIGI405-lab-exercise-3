This morning the Coalition Government announced $38 million of 10-year interest-free loans to the Waikato District Council to support infrastructure projects around the town.
The loans from the $1 billion Housing Infrastructure Fund (HIF) will help the building of 2,790 houses in an area in desperate need of more housing. This will expand water supplies, a new waste water treatment plant and a pipeline.
“This investment will be seen locally as a part of a broad strategy to ensure that growth and development does no further harm to the environment.
“Te Kauwhata waste water will be processed to a higher standard and the discharges of waste into Lake Waikare will be halted.
“The positive impact on the lake and its surrounding wetlands is important to local people and I’m glad that is a positive outcome from this announcement.
“I’m pleased that regional leaders are meeting regularly and see the potential to work with the Government to address and respond to growth challenges in the region,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
