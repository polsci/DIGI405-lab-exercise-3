When Jacinda Ardern, the new Prime Minister of NZ first spoke after it was determined she would lead the Coalition government between Labour and NZ First, with confidence and supply from the Greens, she said we would be an active, focused, empathetic, strong government that is transparent and open. 
When thinking about how to start this speech I wanted to give you all (especially those who don’t already know me) a sense of me the person, the things I care most about and my determination to make change happen for the good in my new ministerial roles.
So I went and looked at my Twitter profile. As you do. I’ve always been mindful that those abbreviated few words actually do matter.

Your first Nethui was in 2011 in Auckland. I was there. Over the weekend when I started writing this speech I had a look at the hot topics discussed back then:
Access and diversity, digital citizenship, globalization, the internet and the law, government and open-ness, innovation and emerging issues, education. These are all very relevant issues today. 
I think I’ve been to every Nethui except for last year in 2016.
I’ve accompanied at least two Labour Party leaders to speak at Nethui. Maybe next year we could aim for the Prime Minister.
One of my most memorable Nethui moments was sitting on a panel with Nikki Kaye from  National and Gareth Hughes from the Greens, challenging them to work together with Labour to create a cross party parliamentary internet forum, which we called the PIF.
We got Tracey Martin from NZ First involved and it has operated for six years, working with Internet NZ to run a series of seminars for MPs on matters of importance and working with the Office of the Clerk to try to make parliament more accessible. With some success. We got the Speaker and the Clerk to agree to livestream some select committee proceedings. Unfortunately the office axed them due to financial constraints.
