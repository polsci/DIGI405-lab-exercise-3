Ka tangi te tītī

INTRODUCTION
The Māori proverb I referred to in my opening remarks speaks of the tītī, or the short-tailed Shearwater bird, which migrates annually to the northern hemisphere and then returns again to New Zealand each year. 
In Māori tradition, birds, or manu, are considered as messengers, guardians and keepers of sacred knowledge.  He rerenga kotuku is referred to as the rare visit of the white heron.  That in a sense is the metaphor for the context of this visit - although we are not frequent visitors to your country, Aotearoa New Zealand enjoys a warm and positive relationship with Chile.
It gives me great pleasure to be invited to participate in this dialogue on indigenous development at the invitation of the Minister of Social Development – Alfredo Moreno to discuss and share experiences from my country’s perspective.
Iwi taketake or indigenous peoples from the four corners of the world have much in common, and the opportunity to share knowledge, experience, insight and inspire the journey we continue to undertake to advance indigenous development can accelerate transformation.
This can impact at all levels to address some common challenges experienced in our respective countries, such as:
improving rural economies
providing for greater participation of indigenous enterprise 
lifting the skill and technological enhancement; and 
accelerate business growth and enhance indigenous co-operation as a core feature of country relationships.
My people hold stories of the kumara or sweet potato which was bought to the shores of Aotearoa New Zealand by a female ancestor Whakaotirangi from Parinuiterā - a place we are told is somewhere in South America.  The planting and storage of this ancient food crop evolved across the Pacific, with very different climatic conditions forming a new knowledge base.  
The Māori people have an ancient tradition of voyaging the Pacific region until landing and settling in Aotearoa New Zealand.  Again this mātauranga or knowledge has remained as a tangible example of how we retain our connection as Māori to the Mapuche people of your region and Rapanui also.
Our country’s experience is that there is the capacity for a Māori world view to influence the significant issues facing our country.  Inequality and poverty, climate change, regional growth and development, the restoration and protection of our rivers, lakes and oceans, the restoration of indigenous biodiversity and traditional knowledge, sustainable food production and economic transformation. 
These are some of the areas that Māori are seeking greater input into shaping the way in which our country determines its way forward.  We are able to assert this viewpoint because of our historical context and the maturing of the way we participate and contribute to our Nations development.  This is not a smooth path but it is a road that we are determined to travel down.
The kaupapa of this forum seeks out perspectives on Indigenous Development. 
Events such as this provide a platform for indigenous, academic and business leaders, alongside government to come together to discuss indigenous development and consider tangible steps to move forward.  Aotearoa New Zealand has a warm relationship with Chile and my visit is another opportunity to reinforce that significance.
In the Pacific we are acutely aware that our Polynesian whānau or family will be significantly affected by rising sea-levels as will several of our coastal communities in Aotearoa New Zealand.  We are prone to the intergenerational impact of inequality and poverty if we do not change.  The time for a fresh perspective and leadership must be now.
Indigenous aspirations have several common denominators but I think the survival and longevity of the next generation and the sustainable use of our natural resources is fundamental.
When I think about the legacy of indigenous leadership in my own country there are numerous examples, as I am sure there are in yours.  People who challenged and changed the status quo, even women who were prepared to stand unencumbered by society or cultural constraints to advocate for change.
So, we are not having a new conversation.  We are mobilising our energy to achieve change for the better, with a collective aspiration in mind. That means Government, business, indigenous communities being prepared to shift the dialogue for change.
I will attempt to characterise the extent of our journey in Aotearoa New Zealand.
WHERE WE HAVE COME FROM
Māori are an indigenous minority in our nation, a consequence of British colonisation of our country.  The historical marker used to demarcate this era in our Nation’s narrative is the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 and is considered the founding document for our country.
The Treaty is an agreement, written in Māori and English that was formed between the British Crown and Māori rangatira or chiefs.  As a broad statement of principles the Treaty was the basis on which Māori and the British made a political pact to found a nation state and constitute a government in Aotearoa New Zealand.
We have had a contested debate about the ability of the Crown to uphold the intentions of the Treaty.  A Tribunal was mandated in 1975 to adjudicate such disputes making recommendations to Government for consideration.  For the purposes of this forum I wish to highlight that the advancement of Māori aspirations has often emerged as a result of the challenge to the principles of the Treaty and its application in law – or might I add, the absence of the Treaty...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(43%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
