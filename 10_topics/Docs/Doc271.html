The importance of trade to New Zealand is a given.
We do not build computers or mobile phones or cars, much medical machinery and medicines; and, because our domestic economy is too small to provide an adequate market for what we are best at producing, we have to sell to the rest of the world in order to pay for the standard of living that we want.
