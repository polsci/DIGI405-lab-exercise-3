Claudelands Conference Centre – Hamilton
Three Waters and the Case for Change
Mihi
I’m pleased to join in welcoming you to Kirikiriroa Hamilton and the Waikato region where I have spent most of my life. I’ve entitled my speech Three Waters and a Case for Change but perhaps to deepen the context I want to draw on the words of my late father who set the blueprint for much of our tribe’s recent development journey in the Waikato. He said:
“Ngā awa itiiti e pa ana ki te wai o Waikato, ko ngā uaua o tō tātou awa.
Tō tātou awa, he manawa. Nō tātou te awa, nō te awa tātou.
E kore e taea te wehe te iwi o Waikato me te awa. He taonga tuku iho
nā ngā tupuna. E whakapono ana mātou ko tā mātou, he tiaki i taua
taonga mo ngā uri whakatupu”.
 
“All the little streams and the rain that flows into the Waikato river are like the veins of the body. The river is our heart. The River belongs to us just as we belong to the river. The Waikato tribe and the River are inseparable. It is a gift left to us by our ancestors and we believe we have the duty to protect that gift for future generations”.
While much of the three waters conversation is about infrastructure, our ability as a country to rise to the challenge of waters reform will have long term benefits to citizens and consumers, and to our environment.
Introduction  
I want to thank Water New Zealand for the invitation address you here today.
To our many overseas guests – in particular Jerry Grant, from Irish Water, Ken Hutchison from Scottish Water, and Alan Sutherland from the Water Industry Commission for Scotland whose organisations hosted my recent fact-finding trip to your countries – nau mai, hāere mai - welcome.
To your President Dukessa Blackburn-Huettner, Chief Executive John Pfahlert, and Water NZ staff I’m sure the conference will be all that you have planned. Can I acknowledge Stuart Crosby, Vice-President of Local Government New Zealand (LGNZ), who you will hear from later today, and other elected officials present.
LGNZ and the entire local government sector have a vital role to play in how we go forward together on the challenges facing our three waters system, and in promoting the necessary related conversations.   
Today I want to update you on where the Government is heading in relation to the Three Waters Review. Much of what I am about to say will sound familiar and that’s because of the country-wide workshops Water NZ members and other stakeholders have hosted canvassing the issues I am about to present. I said very early on in this workstream that in order to work through the range of challenges we will need to work collaboratively to have the ‘right conversation’ and Water NZ has be...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(64%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(27%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
