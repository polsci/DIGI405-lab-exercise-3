In the first quake I slept through most of it. My dad woke me up by shaking me and my brother  and he told us to go to the door frame. When it stopped we all felt sick like we were going to barf. There was no power so we got the batteries out and put them in the radio and listened. My mum called friends and family. Then we got hungry so we had porridge and toast on the barbeque  until the sun came up.
2 days later
There was no school so we stayed home and played games like nothing happened. We still get scared by the aftershocks but we got used to them 
and That is my quake story.
