The phone went dead. I could tell the earthquake was bad because water was sloshing out of the aquarium even worse than the September 2010 earthquake. After the shaking stopped there was silence for a long moment then sirens. I had no idea the earthquake was so severe that so much of the central city had been destroyed and many people had lost their lives until I turned on the radio.
