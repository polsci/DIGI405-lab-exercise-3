Looking back over that time, we are proud of what has been achieved. There remains much to do.

We have begun putting children and families at the heart of our programme, lifting family incomes, backing the regions, making doctors’ visits more affordable, rebuilding hospitals and schools, and beginning the shift to an environmentally sustainable economy.

As 2019 begins the economy is performing above expectations, with near historic low unemployment, and rising wages and targeted support through the Families’ Package.

It is a programme that represents the shared vision and priorities of three parties – Labour, New Zealand First and the Green Party – dedicated to acting in the best interests of all New Zealanders. Together the Speech from the Throne and the commitments in the Coalition agreement and confidence and supply agreement continue to underpin the Government’s work programme.

The Government has demonstrated a new kind of leadership, proving that it is possible to be responsible stewards of the economy, while advancing concepts like compassion and kindness.

We have strong fundamentals and are well prepared, but we need to be realistic about the risks to the global economy. Now is the time to take the foundations we have and to build on them. Now is the time to ensure we not only build greater resilience into our economy, but that we modernise it too. That is what the Government’s policy agenda for 2019 delivers.

As we enter our second full year we continue to advance the Coalition Government’s long- term blueprint for a better New Zealand built around three key themes:

To build a productive, sustainable economy that works for everyone and is fit for the 21st Century.
	To improve the wellbeing of all New Zealanders and their families.
	To take a new approach to leadership, focussing on long term issues.
New Zealand today has solid underlying economic fundamentals. The Coalition Government is on track to deliver better outcomes for all New Zealanders through more productive, sustainable and inclusive growth.

Treasury forecasts GDP growth on average of about 3 per cent in the coming couple of years. We have begun to rebalance the economy away from its undue reliance on speculation and immigration. Net migration, previously a key driver of growth, has fallen by more than 20,000 from its peak in 2016. The property speculation market has cooled and this has resulted in a steadier housing market.

We are ensuring New Zealanders are better off. Inflation remains low and steady. Wages are rising faster than the cost of living, but we acknowledge many New Zealanders are doing it tough. More families will benefit from the Government’s Families Package as the Best Start payments are available for the first full year and full entitlement for the winter energy payments will be available for the first time. Raising the minimum wage means those hard- working Kiwis on the lowes...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(47%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(4%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(4%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
