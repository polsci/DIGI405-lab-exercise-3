I was sleeping peacefully, very early on a Saturday morning, when I was roused by a shaking. Although not yet violent, it was probably about the strongest earthquake I’d ever felt, but in my tired state I saw no sense of urgency. Within seconds, however, the shaking became much stronger, and instinct took hold. 
According to all I’d been taught, the safest place in my room to be was under the door frame at the foot of my bed, and so my wordless thoughts dragged me there very quickly. The house shook in the grips of a jerking sway. The ground rumbled and our timber structure creaked. It was that unmistakable earthquake sound: the occasional crash, smash and bang atop the quake’s unceasing rhythm. This was it: the big quake I’d always longed to feel; and here it was, unexpected and thrilling.
I shouted out to my flatmate to see if he was awake: a silly question really. It turns out he was contending with falling furniture and miscellanies. He replied to check that I’d taken cover, and probably mumbled something about his own predicament. At one point I tried opening his door to check on him, before changing my mind; but I spent most of the quake hugging my doorframe.
Then it stopped.
My flatmate emerged from his room and we exchanged a few words in the power-deprived darkness. I was just about to go downstairs when the first aftershock came, bold and unnerving. And then peace settled. Not that the screech of a hundred security alarms, and the feel of a shaken city coming to life, can quite be described as peace.
A smashed lightbulb littered our entrance, but only because it had been lying on a pile of computers at the top of our stairs. One level of a shelf had collapsed in the lounge, and my flatmate’s top-heavy bench press had toppled into the garage door, forcing it open and damaging the locking mechanism. That, however, was the limit of damage in our house.
Our first priority was to check on our neighbours, so I donned slippers and a jacket. Our first neighbour – an elderly gentleman, whose wife is wheelchair-bound – was quite alright, but profoundly grateful that we came knocking on his door so soon to check on him. Next we thought we might be needed at the neighbouring rest home. There confusion reigned supreme. An old man sat outside; we spoke briefly with him, then my flatmate knocked on the door. An old lady came out.
