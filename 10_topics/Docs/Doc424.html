We have had power on only since 8 last night and despite my computer and keyboard being thrown across the room with all the books and rubbish they are now working!
More importantly we and all our extended family are okay, and alive, but I haven’t heard details. Hamish was teaching at Uni, Claire was teaching at St Margarets, Elliot was at Thorrington School, and little Nina was at pre-school in a wooden 2 storeyed building but it was lunchtime and Nina was outside thank goodness.

We have only seen the TV images for the last few minutes but they look horrible. We can’t see the city from here though I gather some building is on fire.
We have a lot more breakages this time, and mess (think soy sauce, olive oil and olives 4 cm deep in broken stuff on the pantry floor) and several old things have broken this time, but they are only things. The 2 chimneys (or what is left of them after the Sept 4th one) have cracked and split again and the gas fire has parted from the wall, and there are more cracks, just after we’d been assessed for the last one.
