The Government’s policy platform for health is the product of discussion around the country with people like you on the frontline both before and after the election, which is why the opportunity to discuss this with you is valuable to me. I believe in a system that works cooperatively, and can have honest and frank discussions with one another.  We’re not a big system in terms of scale, but we’re rich in innovative and passionate people like yourselves.

The Coalition Government, sees the health and disability system as an asset that belongs to and should serve all New Zealanders.  A high functioning and universal health system is a core part of the make-up of Aotearoa New Zealand.  It reflects the view, from both sides of the political spectrum that all New Zealanders deserve and expect support for their health and wellbeing, so that they can contribute to their communities, families, and wider society.
Challenges
But what we’re seeing and hearing, through the voices of health professionals, consumers and communities across New Zealand is that this asset has not been adequately maintained, or prepared for the future.  This isn’t just the bricks and mortar, it is the people that work in our health system as well, and investment in the areas that we know will help manage future demand. 

Underfunding over the last nine years has strained our system and created the need for significant change.  Health spending peaked at 7.41% of GDP in 2009/10 when the previous Government took over, and dropped to just 5.95% in 2017/18.  DHBs’ have borne the brunt of these cuts, and the Coalition Government has inherited combined DHB deficits of $225 million in 2017/18, up from just $7 million only four years earlier.

Too many New Zealanders are currently being left behind by our health system.  In the almost two decades since the Public Health and Disability Act made removing inequalities an objective of district health boards, overall, only marginal progress has been made.

Many Māori and Pacific New Zealanders, and New Zealanders on lower incomes, still have significantly worse experiences of the health system than the rest of New Zealand.  They have higher rates of major conditions like diabetes, cancer and mental health, have less trust and confidence in the health professionals supporting them, and live shorter lives.
As a country that prides itself on giving everyone a fair deal this cannot be acceptable. We must change how we work to live up to the principle of a public health system that delivers results for all New Zealanders, rather than most New Zealanders.

Underfunding also means that investment to prepare the health system for the future has been overlooked.  Many of you have driven innovation on the frontline to help manage limited resources better, and I thank you for your hard work.  But innovation also means investment in new models of care, new technology, new buildings and infrastructure.
This Government is committed to addressing this need for change, and investing to shift the system back to a sustainable pathway.  It won’t all happen in one year, and things like the 10 year programme of infrastructure investment won’t happen in one electoral cycle, but this Government is committed to facing the hard choices needed to put the system on sound foundations for the future.

What this means for you, as the people that form the lifeblood of our system, is that you have the support of a Government that is making historic levels of investment in health, and a Government that is listening and working alongside DHBs rather than against them.
My priority - Equity
My core priority as Minister of Health is improved equity of health outcomes New Zealanders experience.  The disparities different people face are largely preventable, yet persistent across the health and disability system.  This failing for groups of New Zealand’s population carries costs for us as a country, for communities and for individuals in terms of money and quality of life.   I want a health system that delivers the same high-quality health outcomes for all people, s...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(42%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(32%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
