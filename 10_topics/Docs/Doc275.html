Greetings and acknowledgements to you all Waikato. It feels great to be back in your region and to celebrate with you our thriving Pacific languages, cultures and identities.
Can I acknowledge Leaupepe Rachel Karalus and the team at K’aute Pasifika and everyone behind the scenes for organizing this fantastic Nesian Festival.
With me this morning is MP Jamie Strange and your local Hamilton City Councillors. Thank you guys for your wonderful support for the Waikato Nesian Festival.
Last year when I was here, I spoke to you about my intentions as Minister for Pacific Peoples and the need for us as a community to assess where we have come from, where we are, and what kind of future we see for ourselves in Aotearoa, New Zealand.
I am happy to report that since then, I and the Ministry for Pacific Peoples have engaged with over 2,500 Pacific peoples from across Aotearoa New Zealand and we have been laying the foundations for a programme of work that will support the thriving Pacific community in Aotearoa New Zealand.
Upon this foundation we are building a partnership between me, as the Minister for Pacific Peoples; the team of dedicated, passionate and talented staff we have working for us around the country; and you, the community.
What this partnership represents is a shared understanding of the power we all hold to change people’s lives by working together with them, and their families.
Last year, we launched the Lalanga Fou report at our Pacific Aotearoa summit. That report highlighted that Pacific identity, language and culture, economic development and income, education, health and wellness as key areas to realising their full potential.
We have taken this work and started developing a range of initiatives focused on the wellbeing of Pacific people, their families and their communities.
Since then, every discussion we have had about how to allocate public resources to support our people, every meeting, every debate, your aspirations as captured in the Pacific Aotearoa Lalanga Fou report has been at the centre of those discussions.
We also launched The New Zealand Pacific Economy report that was prepared by Treasury. This report showed that Pacific peoples contribute $8 Billion to New Zealand’s economy, and that’s despite the challenges of inequality and barriers Pacific people’s face in the areas of housing, health, education and employment.
Since the release of that report, I continue to advocate – imagine the kind of contribution Pacific peoples can make if we eliminated the barriers and inequalities they face.  The challenge of eliminating inequities in our society requires all of us to play our part.  We, collectively must be ambitious for the general wellbeing of our communities.
At the end of this month, when we announce our first ever Wellbeing Budget, we will be able to tell you more about what you have helped create.
Our Wellbeing Budget is about measuring things differently - not just in economic terms, but by the good it creates in people’s lives and tackling New Zealand’s long-term challenges.
GDP measures might include the number of people in the workforce; how many businesses are operating in your community; how much people earn, and how much they spend and on what goods they buy. But GDP does not measure the joy each of you feel from our event today. It does not measure the excitement and confidence your children experience from dancing and singing as Pacific peoples of Aotearoa. It doesn’t measure the quality of work and effort by loving volunteers who give freely ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(52%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
