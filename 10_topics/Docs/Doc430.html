Tuesday, 22 February 2011 11:54:49 a.m.  ( I had arrived back on the 21st from a trip to Auckland and was emailing my friends to thank them.)  

1)   Dear Raema and Rex, 

Got back to ChCh on time after a bit of a bumpy ride at the end and am just catching up today – it has been raining so no gardening today. 

Hope you got home safely Raema and thanks for taking me to the airport and of course I can’t thank you enough for all you did to make my stay so great. 
my god  we have just had a major shake and I feel so shaky  everytning id swaying.   love  H 
2)  To my son in Seattle referring to the Christchurch family of Sarah, Martin and the 2 grandchildren Tom and Jess

Dear Michael,   

I am OK  – the shop is a mess but S and M are OK though they have not been able to get in touch with Tom who is at home alone.  We can’t get through to the city at all now on cell or land line and its very difficult.  I  have gone to be with Eric and some other friends and we are all trying to  get hold of relatives.  Earlier on  I heard from Sarah and she was going to get S from school.  There are casualties this time.  I wonder how we will recover. 

Love  Mum
3)   To Raema and Rex,   I am OK – am with Eric and some other friends.  the shop is a mess – have only had a brief cell message from Sarah.  She was going to get Jess from school but hadn’t been able to get hold of Tom who was at home so now no way of contacting them.  Everyone is trying to get hold of family.   love Hilary
4)   Dear Michael, I  am going in to pick up Sarah and children then will be home – my phone should be working there so you could try in a couple of hours 
5)  From Michael in the USA  

How horrible. I tried calling but couldn’t get you or Sarah. Talked to Anna who said Tom has been contacted and is okay. I hope Jess and Kirsty’s family are all okay. It must be so hard. I can’t believe it’s even worse this time. I’m thinking of you and will try to call you later on your mobile.
6)    From Michael.So Jess is OK? 
7)    From me -Yes.  Sarah is walking to get her as she doesn’t have enough petrol 
8)    22nd Feb 9.30pm. 

Dear Friends, Thank you all so much for your very kind messages and calls.  It was extremely frightening even though I had very little damage ( as far as I know) but so much worse for the ChCh people.  It is so hard to believe all the deaths and injuries could happen here.  

We are fortunate that all the family are safe and Sarah Martin Jess and Tom are staying out here with me.  Their new shop is of course closed – no power and lots of cracking in the walls and damage to stock –  they had to get out without even emptying the till, then it took Sarah 2 hours to get across town to pick up Jess from school.  Tom was home alone when it hit so an awful shock for him.  They had lots of breakages – all their good china and glasses smashed, all t...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(51%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>children quake 4 christchurch night family back love feel christmas quakes year bed 5 birthday 6 earth world today sleep</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>water home house back road day power work time drive 3 damage city hours morning made car traffic days christchurch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>home back house didn thought shaking door car quake floor day time school earthquake felt people hit family ground started</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people christchurch city earthquake time ve day good things life work earthquakes buildings february place september lot damage 2011 months</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>building street people collapsed road square park desk car phone back buildings asked office rubble point walking made floor told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people lyttelton earthquake things house thing bit community stuff didn good back interview thought don fire put bettina lot feel</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>normal water silt truck quake chimney roads big hole buildings road quakes high bricks sand houses st wall walls men</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>home insurance builder land house manager neighbour 2 homes fence project asked insurer repair site company property claims 3 builders</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>pain god things hospital time good made back don car injury road lord scott nurses day spinal walk helped put</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>building jo mayor earthquake time bob team gallery art city ann teams civic council task latimer block staff found canterbury</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
