                     2011.     

It was lunch time and everyone was outside having lunch. I was sitting on the

toilet  doing my business until I felt a movement on my feet then everything started

to shake for a while then the quaking started to calm down  then became silent.
I rushed outside and saw teachers leading children across the field towards the Safe-

-zone.I was searching for my classmates and they were waiting outside of the school

Library. My classmates and I stayed with our teacher and walked towards the field 

Safezone.
That afternoon was the most frightening experience in my whole life. Mum picked me and my sisters up from work. On the drive home I saw people carrying things out of houses, roads cracked and damaged, and  liquid spilling out of the gutters all across the streets.it happened everywhere along the way home. I was shocked when I watched the evening news that was all about the earthquake that hit us around lunch.    
The next day school was off for a couple of days we were driving from our house across the streets. The drive was longer than before because of the roads that had been closed off and the repairs, so we drove the long way to stay at my cousin’s houses for three days.
Days later we walked from our cousin’s house to school but saw teachers standing outside the gates greeting and telling people about the early hall meeting before lunchtime, the earthquake news and how many people died during the earthquake and aftershocks.
The End.
