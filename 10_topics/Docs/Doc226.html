Tuesday 12 February 2019, Bell Gully, 171 Featherston Street, Wellington
 Thank you for inviting me to launch this latest Environmental Defence Society (EDS) publication, the Synthesis Report, which so many in the room have helped with.
I congratulate the New Zealand Law Foundation, Employers and Manufacturers Association (EMA), Property Council New Zealand and Infrastructure New Zealand for their support of this 18-month long project. This is a significant contribution.
Thanks to the report’s authors Raewyn Peart and Dr Greg Severinsen, and to the numerous other contributors. Congratulations also to Raewyn for recently being made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the New Year’s Honours list, awarded for her outstanding contribution to environmental and conservation policy. This report adds to your already impressive body of work.  
EDS has been asking hard questions about the direction of New Zealand’s environmental policy development for many years. As far back as the Beyond the RMA conference in 2007, it was pointing out that poor environmental outcomes had worsened in key areas ­­– and consequently EDS had found little reprieve from its adversarial role as ‘public environmental defender’. It concluded that a more systematic approach to the problems was required, rather than a litigious one.
That conference challenged attendees to look to the future. It is now over a decade later and unfortunately many of the problems identified by participants have not been adequately addressed.
The time is now right for a “rethink”, as EDS puts it. Clearly there is both a need and an opportunity to create a system that better enables economic growth within environmental limits and bottom lines, and which aligns the economy with the environment.
It’s particularly useful to go back to first principles as EDS has done in this latest report. This gives us solid foundations on which to build our ideas about the future resource management system. The Government’s approach to the resource management system reform will be informed by this work.
The Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) was a significant step forward for environmental management in New Zealand when it was introduced, and reduced the complexity that had existed. But it has also been the subject of sustained criticism and debate. 
The Government recognises that the RMA is underperforming in some critical areas. Plan making is too slow. There has been too little spatial planning around growing urban populations and the cumulative effect of intensification of land use on water has been poorly managed. It is clear that the system has not delivered the outcomes New Zealanders expect and deserve.
Of course, this report is about more than just the RMA. The system more broadly includes infrastructure planning and financing under the Local Government Act and Land Transport Management Act, and problems caused by the Building Act – as well as wider approaches to conservation and fisheries. 
This broader viewpoint is important, because often the RMA is made the scapegoat for other failures. It is also important to note that law changes cannot of themselves fix implementation failures by both central and local government. Local government, mayors and councillors have responsibility for how their building and planning departments perform or underperform.
The government already has a wide-ranging work programme underway to improve the resource management system. I don’t have time to go into everything in detail, but I’ll touch on a few milestones we can expect this year. In pursuing these, we are not going to wait for comprehensive RMA reform.
Freshwater
As you know, a priority for me is to put in place a new framework for freshwater management. We are working on a package of water initiatives with the aim to firstly halt further degradation of water quality, then improve water quality over time. Detailed policy development is well underway and we will be consulting on a regulatory package this year.
Urban Development
This year we will progress legislation to set up the Housing and Urban Development Authority to fast-track housing and urban development projects, a model not uncommon overseas. The Authority will offer a new way of planning large-scale and complex development so we can achieve scale and pace, while also retaining the importance of great urban design.
As part of the Urban Growth Agenda, the Government intends to soon consult on national direction for ensuring urban planning rules respond to growth and enable quality intensification. The new Ministry of Housing and Urban Development is also working in partnership with local government on progressing new regional approaches to spatial planning in some of our fastest growing urban areas. We are also developing infrastructure funding alternatives.
Climate change
This year we will legislate for our 2050 climate change emissions target. Putting a new target into legislation will both hold this government, and successive ones, to account and try to depoliticise the pathway to achieving that target. The legislation will establish an independent Climate Change Commission to guide New Zealand towards a low emissions resilient economy. 
It will look at how we transition to 100% renewable electricity by 2035 and determine how to bring agriculture into the Emissions Trading Scheme.
Compliance, monitoring and enforcement
Another important move that will help restore faith in our environmental law is to improve enforcement of the rule of law. A new RMA Enforcement Unit is being established inside the Environmental Protection Authority to improve compliance with the rules we already have. Part of the problem we have with the RMA is that rules have not been enforced.
Comprehensive RMA review 
The work I have just described can be expected to make a big difference. The steps we are taking to improve freshwater, rural land use and urban development, and to address climate change, will inform a comprehensive review of the RMA that I believe is needed. The time is now right to do this.
We know that this review will be complex, and that is why I have deliberately been taking a staged approach to it. I am grateful to the many groups that are helping. The first stage is a Bill that is currently being drafted, and I would expect will be introduced in the coming couple of months to address issues with the current RMA that need fixing now. This will largely reverse changes made through the 2017 RMA amendments that were widely criticised by all sides, but wi...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(40%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(38%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
