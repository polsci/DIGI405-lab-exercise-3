Thank you for the invitation to speak at The Point 2018. It’s exciting to have so many innovators and payment systems experts in one room. 
Today I will provide a view from the Government that emphasises the importance of a well-functioning payment system for the economy. 
I’ll cover progress made so far on initiatives to improve consumer outcomes as well as my expectations for future development. 
And I’ll also speak more broadly about how we plan to engage with broader changes taking place in the banking sector – particularly with regard to Open Banking opportunities. 
To start with, my priority is making an impact for everyday New Zealanders 
As Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, my objective is for all sectors of the economy to operate efficiently and provide benefits to everyday New Zealanders.  
This requires businesses to have confidence in the environment in which they operate, but also for consumers to be protected and empowered. 
There are significant work streams in my portfolio of Commerce and Consumer Affairs that have a remarkable reach into everyday lives. Payments is one of them.  
It is this Government’s goal to deliver an inclusive and sustainable economy for all New Zealanders. 
We want to create an economic environment that encourages innovation, delivers competitive markets and supports honest business. 
I acknowledge that New Zealand’s retail payment systems are a vital part of the economy and will play a vital role in this Government’s vision. 
Efficient payment systems provide crucial infrastructure for commerce.  
They are a fundamental aspect of the economy that needs to work for everyone. 
They need to work for consumers so they are able to buy the goods and services they need. 
They need to work for retailers so that they can efficiently sell their offerings. 
They create opportunities for newer providers and innovators to offer services which can add value to business and consumers. 
We can be proud that New Zealand has been a world leader in payment systems. 
It is because of this success that electronic payments have become essential to almost all New Zealanders. 
It is therefore critical that we take steps to ensure that we continue to reap the benefits of a world-leading system, by encouraging ongoing innovation; and the costs associated with New Zealand’s payment systems are shared fairly between New Zealand businesses and consumers.
 Innovation is key 
My interest is in encouraging competition and innovation, as new and innovative payment products can provide significant benefits to consumers, merchants, the financial sector, and the wider economy.  
There are some great developments that are taking place in the sector: 
Contactless cards are now ubiquitous and speeding up payments across the country; 
Apple Pay has rapidly increased its penetration since it launched in New Zealand, alongside a growing list of other mobile payment apps;
Innovative new local start-ups are making exciting progress in delivering new payment solutions for New Zealanders; and
the worldwide development of open access APIs will allow all sorts of products to plug into the banking system and provide more choice for a lower cost.  
I want to be clear that the government wants to help foster this innovation, not get in the way of it.  
But at the same time, I think New Zealand can do  better. We were among the first in the world to introduce EFTPOS in the ‘80s, and there’s no reason we can’t be at the front of the pack in introducing payments innovations going forward.  
My view that most effective progress will be achieved when all players in the payments ecosystem work together to achieve the best environment for innovation. 
And given the opportunities available in this sector, there is no excuse for standing still.  
Issues in retail payments systems  
There have been some issues identified within the retail payments systems that we are working through. 
Many of you will be familiar with the work that MBIE has undertaken in this area including the 2016 issues paper  that expressed some concerns about how merchant service fees and interchange fees are incentivising consumers to use certain forms of payment over other, potentially cheaper, ones.  
It outlined how the growth in credit card reward programmes could be increasing prices of goods and services for all consumers, while only benefiting the holders of these cards.  
It identified concerns about the level of fees that merchants, particularly small ones, face for accepting payment.  
The report also outlined that many merchants are confused by the payments landscape and the fees that they are charged.  
Steps taken to date 
Since then, we have continued to work constructively together on how we can make progress and I have personally met with many of you on this topic. 
I am grateful to everyone who has got involved.  
Since I became the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs I have been looking for progress that shows me: 
further gains in respect on competition, innovation, and efficiency in the provision of retail payment systems; and  
fairness for retailers and consumers when using the principal payment products used every day by millions of New Zealanders. 
It is encouraging that progress has been made and that developments appear to be heading in the right direction. 
In particular, Visa and MasterCard have recognised that some of the fees fall unfairly on smaller retailers and lowered the caps for some interchange fees appropriately from April this year.   
Those companies have also made a commitment to provide more transparency going forward on trends in average interchange fees over time.
Expectations for existing payment systems 
I do have a few expectations regarding debit and credit products that I would like to make clear before talking about some of the more innovative work in the payments industry. 
Firstly, I do not want to see further increases in interchange fees or merchant service fees for credit cards and debit cards.  I acknowledge that interchange fees and merchant service fees have their place.  However, I do not think further increases are in the interests of consumers or the wider economy.  I have chosen not to go down the route of Australia or the European Union in respect of regulating interchange fees.  However that option remain...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(50%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
