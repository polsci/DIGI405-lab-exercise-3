We have our first project control meeting at 8am.   We find out that when Builder 2 built our foundation, he embedded a conduit for a fibre optic company that was not our provider, into the concrete.  Different companies use different conduits. That means the fibre for the company we are with can’t go through that conduit and will have to go in through a vent in the hebel wall.  
Spring comes with a rush – warm days, and delicate blossoms, with splashes of vivid yellow daffodils.  Clouds of pine pollen from Bottle Lake Forest fall in great yellow drifts, fine as dust.  We head into town on a recommendation and go out for dinner with friends.  It is a gorgeous winter’s evening and great to see so many people back in town.  We have a great time.  
Our project manager (at our request), e-mails a weekly update.  Things are going well.  We start to relax.  I think of the 46m long neon artwork on the wall of the Arts Centre. The large letters are each a different colour.  It practically shouts EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT.  One of the letters is no longer lit up.  It makes me smile.
The City Council publishes results of a regular wellbeing survey. 64% of homes have been or are in the process of repair, 30% are resolved, 22% are concerned about the quality of repair, 10% are taking action to resolve poor repairs and 6% are repairs of repairs. 
We have a repair of a repair of a repair.  It has been 3 years since we moved out of home.  We have been renting all of that time and our possessions are still mostly packed in boxes in the garage.
My sister’s partner has had a bad year health wise.  After four operations to remove two massive kidney stones he has to have another one to remove an infection in the stump of the leg he had amputated following a vehicle accident in his teens.  My sister is again flying from Sydney (where she works) to Cairns (where he lives) to look after him.  It is very wearying and worrying.  
I am clenching my teeth while I sleep, which is giving me earache.  Massage every fortnight is relieving this and helping me sleep.  The masseuse says I have to find peace as the focus on our repair for such a long time is no good for my health.   I need to relax, and just let things play out.  
Our chimney has never been scoped as part of our insurance claim.   I request this is added, but this is rejected by our Loss Adjuster as he can’t find a photo of it on our file.  He has checked Google Earth 2014 and can not see a chimney.  He does not think to look at Google Earth prior to the earthquakes when we actually had a chimney.  It makes me laugh.
I send him photos pf our chimney and a link to Google earth 2011 where our chimney is plan to see.   The Loss Adjuster is lovely, and accepts the amendment and asks the Quantity surveyor to price it.
My mother’s cousin Alan is in the Dominion Post on 10 September.  Robert Holland Taylor (my great grandfather), soldier 25/915 was 22 when he joined the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, on 12 October, 1915. When he sailed for Egypt four months later, on the steamship Ulimaroa, he listed Lucy Taylor –his wife of barely two years –as next of kin. His one-year-old son Charles is Allan’s dad.
In February 1919, after three bloody years on the Western Front, Bert – his sleeve bearing two wounded stripes  -came home.  Allan says “To a certain extent, I think my grandfather’s life ended when the war ended.  Despite his intelligence and ability, he was a man without any ambition. Whether the war had knocked it out of him, I don’t know. As long as he could get a game of bowls and had his pipe and could tell stories, he was just content. His brother was a company director and yet...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(40%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>home insurance builder land house manager neighbour 2 homes fence project asked insurer repair site company property claims 3 builders</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people christchurch city earthquake time ve day good things life work earthquakes buildings february place september lot damage 2011 months</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>home back house didn thought shaking door car quake floor day time school earthquake felt people hit family ground started</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>water home house back road day power work time drive 3 damage city hours morning made car traffic days christchurch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>pain god things hospital time good made back don car injury road lord scott nurses day spinal walk helped put</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people lyttelton earthquake things house thing bit community stuff didn good back interview thought don fire put bettina lot feel</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(2%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>normal water silt truck quake chimney roads big hole buildings road quakes high bricks sand houses st wall walls men</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(2%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>building street people collapsed road square park desk car phone back buildings asked office rubble point walking made floor told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>building jo mayor earthquake time bob team gallery art city ann teams civic council task latimer block staff found canterbury</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>children quake 4 christchurch night family back love feel christmas quakes year bed 5 birthday 6 earth world today sleep</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
