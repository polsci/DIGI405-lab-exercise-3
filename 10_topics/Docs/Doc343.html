A story of Anger – Trauma – Encouragement – Compassion, and Hope.
My little car was a beauty, a Mitsubishi Mirage Dingo, with only 43,000 ks on the clock a 1.3 litre car. It wasn’t until I spotted this other one in a yard one day exactly the same as mine but it had tinted windows and a better motor 1.5 litre Gdi and only 27,000 k’s. I was hooked so I changed mine for it. What the Gdi stood for I don’t know. (Something injection.) Lovely high seats for comfort, just a beauty!

On the back window I had the words  “The Red baron“ which I changed because my wife didn‘t like it, to “L.B.W.” which were my initials and most people thought of “Leg before wicket.” I couldn’t get the number plate as someone had it, but they said I could have it as I L.B.W. I If I wanted it, but I declined.
Leading Up To Events.
My name is Lawrence and I am a 72 yr old New Zealander born and bred in Christchurch.

I was made Paralysed by medical misadventure.

It all happened on the 4th July 2010 when I was asked to have an MRI scan and I was in extreme pain after having a disc in my back collapse and all my nerves were crushed. As I sat in the waiting room it got worse and I could hardly walk, and had to be assisted up onto the MRI table and down again.
Those who had the knowledge and power to say “Off to the Hospital” had diagnosed me wrong. The Radiologist showed me the severity of my Disc collapse but chose to say, “You’ll be ok,” and sent me home. I had an injection from my own Dr, but it didn’t alter the pain at all.

Within just a few hrs I was rushed to A&E dept Christchurch Hospital for urgent surgery as I had become paralysed from the waist down. The Ambulance staff carried me out from my bed to the Ambulance outside. I felt every bump in the road on the journey to the hospital but the ambulance men were very good at their job calming me down as much as possible.
I had to endure being there at A&E lying flat on my back and in excruciating  pain watching others who were just drunk and a young girl who slit her wrists because she wasn’t getting attention fast enough. This in turn took the Dr’s away from me.
So many people coming in (Mainly elderly) and those who even in the early hrs of the morning had been in accidents. It took my mind off things for a moment.

My wife was at my side and also my Daughter which was lovely to see as they kept me calm by talking just about everything. What a blessing they were to me.

I had an ECG, and Pic line inserted with injections going in to try and lower the pain level which helped only slightly.
They said I would have to have an x-ray because my heart wasn’t functioning properly. ( I had Atrial Fibrillation). It skipped a beat every four beats and sent blood rushing to my head. Sometimes it made me light headed.

After being wheeled into the x-ray room by this young attendant, and being bumped around going through doorways (and I felt every one) they said that I had to sit up and I thought, Why can’t they just slide the board under me? It just didn’t make sense?
I was made to sit up to a 90 degree angle and as they pushed just that little bit more I felt something in my back snap and the pain was greater than the first. The young girls had snapped two bones off my disc or spine and I was in extreme agony.

Apologies were made (I think?) and I finally was wheeled into the surgery room after getting the appropriate injections.
I came out of surgery and the first thing the surgeon said was Quote “It was the largest disc I have ever seen and I removed two other bones that had broken off as well. The disc blew out of your back and hit me on the chest” Unquote. 

Can I show this to the medical school here? I told him that’s fine go for it.
I spent 5 days in ICU and then transferred to ward 28 on this wonderful bed which had all the mod cons fitted but as I was wheeled past the reception part of the ward the nurse in charge said in a loud voice, “Oh! No! you can’t have that bed in here.” I hoped she was only joking but she wasn’t and I had to have a standard bed.
Earthquakes and things 
Finally I was taken by ambulance to Burwood Spinal Unit where I was to be there for about five months.

 It was here that my story starts regarding Earthquakes and things. 

They had wheeled me into a room, and before long the nurses brought someone else in so I had someone to talk to. 
He appeared to be a small man, but then after talking to him I realised that this man they brought in had been run over by a train, and it happened because he slipped on new paint on the platform as it had been raining.  The doors were locked on the train and he couldn’t get on.

 He fell under the moving train and ended up with just one small left limb, no legs or hands, and no right limb at all. I don’t know how he survived. He didn’t seem to know who he was and his story was in the papers across New Zealand.
I spoke to the head nurse Anna who came to help me and said to her, “He must be the worst case here, and to my surprise she said “No!” you are. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing anyway as time went by the nurses changed me as I had lost Bladder and Bowel control which had to be attended to daily three or four times & injections every four hrs for infections that had taken place. (Chest, Bladder, Stomach, and I felt feverish and was shaking and had pneu...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(67%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>pain god things hospital time good made back don car injury road lord scott nurses day spinal walk helped put</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>home back house didn thought shaking door car quake floor day time school earthquake felt people hit family ground started</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>water home house back road day power work time drive 3 damage city hours morning made car traffic days christchurch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(4%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people christchurch city earthquake time ve day good things life work earthquakes buildings february place september lot damage 2011 months</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>building street people collapsed road square park desk car phone back buildings asked office rubble point walking made floor told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people lyttelton earthquake things house thing bit community stuff didn good back interview thought don fire put bettina lot feel</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>normal water silt truck quake chimney roads big hole buildings road quakes high bricks sand houses st wall walls men</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>home insurance builder land house manager neighbour 2 homes fence project asked insurer repair site company property claims 3 builders</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>children quake 4 christchurch night family back love feel christmas quakes year bed 5 birthday 6 earth world today sleep</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>building jo mayor earthquake time bob team gallery art city ann teams civic council task latimer block staff found canterbury</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
