Thank you for the opportunity to come talk to you today. We are celebrating the opportunity we all have to identify and buy New Zealand fish, especially those recognised as meeting the high bar set by the Marine Stewardship Council for sustainable fisheries.
Fishing is important to the New Zealand economy and our society. It plays an important cultural and recreational role in New Zealand, as well as contributing 16,000 jobs and $4.2 billion in total economic activity. The global recognition of Brand New Zealand is key to our export fisheries, worth an estimated $1.6 billion to New Zealand.
New Zealanders expect our fisheries to be sustainably managed and need to have trust and confidence in how this is done. This has to be underpinned by transparency and accountability.
We have established Fisheries New Zealand to sharpen the lens on fisheries and improve our relationships with iwi and stakeholders to build trust in our fisheries management and the sustainability of our fisheries. 
I have asked Fisheries New Zealand to be innovative in the way they engage and communicate with iwi, with communities, with fishers across all sectors and with the ENGOs.
The focus must be not on why things can’t be done but on how they can be.  My expectation of the team at Fisheries New Zealand is that they take a positive approach as solution providers and enablers.
 The certification by the MSC of these fisheries provides validation of the strong bones of our fisheries management system and our ability to manage sustainably with investment in robust science and collaborating to find innovative solutions that support the reputation of Brand New Zealand. 
Certified New Zealand fisheries
Eight New Zealand fisheries have achieved Marine Stewardship Council certification.
Nearly 50% by volume of New Zealand’s wild-caught fish is currently certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council, and certified products are worth an estimated $415 million per year in export value. 
New Zealand’s journey with the Marine Stewardship Council began in 2001, when hoki became the first New Zealand fishery and also the first whitefish fishery globally to be recognised as meeting the Marine Stewardship Council certification requirements. 
Since then, hoki has been recertified twice, and New Zealand hake, ling, southern blue whiting, albacore tuna, Ross Sea Antarctic toothfish, orange roughy, and most recently skipjack tuna, have also been recognised as meeting the certification requirements.
I’m happy to announce the recent publication of the public comment draft report for our hoki, hake, ling trawl fishery, southern blue whiting, and ling bottom longline fisheries. While the report is still draft and open for public comment, it is encouraging to see the initial recommendation that these key fisheries be certified with no conditions.
These certifications underpin New Zealand’s reputation for well-managed, sustainable fisheries and the recognition of Brand New Zealand worldwide.
MSC certification helps New Zealand fish products access premium markets. It provides consumers with assurances of the sustainability of the seafood and knowledge that they are buying products harvested with the future of our oceans in mind.
I am very keen to see value growth for our seafood industry through accreditation from schemes such as the Marine Stewardship Council, and broader consumer recognition of the quality and sustainability of New Zealand’s seafood products.
Science 
To support our brand credentials, and the ability to achieve Marine Stewardship Council certification, requires a rigorous and defensible scientific evidence base.
The New Zealand government and the fishing industry invest heavily in fisheries science and research.
Research has demonstrated the health of the certified target stocks and the extent of the impacts of the fisheries on the environment, and has informed management and mitigation approaches.
It is important that fisheries data is both accurate and verifiable. Data sources include industry reporting of catch and effort, verified by returns from fish receivers, Fisheries New Zealand observers at sea who measure over half a million individual fish annually, multi-species trawl surveys, and complex statistical fish stock population models. All research outputs are thoroughly peer-reviewed to ensure they represent the best available information and provide a solid ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(57%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(2%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
