It takes a great deal of effort to organise a major conference and I would like to start by acknowledging the voluntary effort from the conference committee:
Wellington branch of NZ Association for Environmental Education
Department of Conservation 
Enviroschools, Victoria University, Hutt City Council, Wellington City Council, Wellington Sustainability Trust and Wellington Gardens
Without sponsors, these events could not take place – so thanks to your sponsors  University of Auckland, UNESCO, Auckland Council, Greater Wellington Regional Council, Victoria University, MPI and Zealandia 
This kaupapa is important because it is vital to provide everyone in our country with the tools and knowledge they need to make the best decisions for their environment, community and future. 
Learning about real issues and taking action at the grassroots level can help whānau, communities and organisations, as well as local and central government.
Many people are involved in educating young people and communities to enable a sustainable, resilient, equitable and prosperous future. Many of you are in this room today and I want to recognise your efforts.
The Government’s focus
The coalition agreement between Labour and New Zealand First, and Labour’s confidence and supply agreement with the Green Party; both share this mission statement:
“Together, we will work to provide New Zealand with a transformational government, committed to resolving the greatest long-term challenges for the country, including sustainable economic development, increased exports and decent jobs paying higher wages, a healthy environment, a fair society and good government. We will reduce inequality and poverty and improve the well-being of all New Zealanders and the environment we live in.”
The Prime Minister has set an agenda for our Government to deliver shared prosperity, removing the social and infrastructure deficits that have emerged, and to shifting the focus to improving the wellbeing of all our people, especially those most vulnerable – our children. We can only do this if we pay equal attention to our environment: Papatūānuku, Ranginui, Tangaroa and all that sustain us.
In recent years we have seen continuing degradation of our freshwater and waterways. The decline is caused by effluent and nutrients from intensive rural land use, land use practice in activities like forestry and housing development earthworks, and waste water getting into our storm water. We have also seen contamination of drinking water. 
Community action involving councils, marae, local business and schools is important if we are to clean up local waterways. For example, the WaiRestoration programme by the Toimata Foundation and Northland Regional Council has made good progress. The Government helps by co-funding projects. The funds we use are sourced from: Mana o Te Wai, the Community Environment Fund and the Freshwater Improvement Fund. Together we can mobilise the immense power of informed and active communities...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(36%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(4%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
