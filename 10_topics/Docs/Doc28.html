My greetings to all those who bear authority gathered here.
Haere mai tatau ki tenei ra nui, ki tenei ra o Waitangi.
Welcome to us all as we gather on the important day of Waitangi.
E koa ana ahau, te tae penei mai, me taku pae arahi. He kawenga rangatira, kua tukuna mai.
I am pleased to be escorted here as I am today. I acknowledge the privilege extended to me.
Aku mihi ano hoki, mo nga kupu whakatau, i a matau katoa.
And I wish also to acknowledge the words of welcome extended to Government.
 
I want to begin by acknowledging mana whenua. Ngāti Kawa, Ngāti Rahiri, and, of course, Ngāpuhi.
I want to acknowledge the members of the Waitangi National trust, who sit to my right today and, particularly, those to my left who have shepherded me warmly on to the whare today. 
I do not take lightly the privilege extended to me to speak from this veranda today, not only as Prime Minister, but as a wahine. Tena Koutou katoa.
I also acknowledge those who joined me as we walked on this marae today. I acknowledge particularly Te Rōpū Reipa, all of my team, who I am immensely proud to stand alongside. 
I am particularly proud to stand alongside the largest Maori contingent of MPs that our party has seen. And it is not just the numbers that matter. It is the fact that each and every one of them are from amongst their people and represent their people. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but our waiata has also improved considerably from last year.
I also acknowledge the other members of this government. It is made up of three parties. Our coalition partners, New Zealand First. Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, I acknowledge you and Shane Jones, who has spoken on behalf of New Zealand First today. And our confidence and supply partners, the New Zealand Green Party, and all of their MPs who have joined us today. 
As a government, we have been here for five days. I have not been on my own. We did not come simply for the beauty and the hospitality of the North. We came because there is work to do. Much mahi to do. And we will only achieve what needs to be done, together. So, in those five days, we have talked about education, health, employment, roads, housing. But now we must take the talk to action. This is the beginning for our government, and I thank you.
We also bring with us a special role in Minister Kelvin Davis, who holds for the first time the portfolio of Crown/Maori relations. We did not create that role lightly. As we discuss here with Ngāpuhi the Treaty settlement, that is before us, within our sights, we also have to start thinking as a nation of what extends beyond the negotiating table. That is not the end of our relationship, nor is it the end of the Crown’s responsibility. 
Each agreement we have signed so far, contains 7,000 commitments. We must be diligent about upholding each of them. We have created the portfolio of Crown/Maori relations as an acknowledgement that our relationship goes beyond the negotiating table and it will continue on with strength and with hope.
 I also acknowledge the opposition members who have journeyed on in the marae with us today in what seems a historic moment, for all of the Parliament to be represented here, together.
As I stand here, I have many memories of the many times that I have visited these beautiful grounds, not always a politician but once as a child. In fact, my first time here, I was probably no more than seven years old. My father brought his two daughters to the Treaty grounds because he had a great love of history and he wanted us to learn the history of the place we were living and were lucky enough to call home. I remember standing out on the grounds and, after we had finis...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(49%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
