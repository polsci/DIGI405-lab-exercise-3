16 October 2018
Thank you for having me here today.
This month marks the first anniversary of this coalition Government.
We came to office promising to rebalance the economy away from its excessive reliance on speculation and immigration towards productive investment.
In the words of the deputy prime minister, to reject the notion that the modified status quo would do.
And we are on the way. 
Today I want to take this opportunity to recap the measures we have put in place and draw together the strands of our plan for a more sustainable, productive and inclusive economy
When I asked the Prime Minister for the Economic Development and Environment roles I was not simply choosing
the areas that interest me. Though of course they are fascinating. I chose them because I thought we can and will make a difference to improve the lives of New Zealanders.
Together with my Trade and Export Growth portfolio they are areas that must work together to bring about some of the key changes we want to see in New Zealand.
Changes that will make our economy more productive. 
Changes that will ensure economic growth is within environmental limits. 
Changes that are inclusive, benefitting all New Zealanders. 
Changes that will speed the transition from volume to value and boost the creation of higher paid jobs. 
Let’s begin with what’s going well. Then move on to the international economic challenges we face. And finally I’ll set out some of my thoughts on how we can respond to those challenges, linking
up across government to make a Just Transition to the future for New Zealand we want to see. 
Much about our economy is going well
So, to begin, I’m pleased to say that our economy today enjoys many strengths.
On traditional measures, the key macro indicators are good.
Inflation remains low and steady.
Economic growth forecasts are solid, averaging around 3% and the June quarter came in at 1 per cent.
Unemployment is low, at 4.5%, and projected to fall further towards 4%.
There are signs that real wages are improving.
Government debt as a proportion of our economy is among the lowest of any developed country, at close to our 20 per cent of GDP target, and coming down thanks to our ongoing surpluses.
Interest rates are low and set to stay low for some time.
We are boosting infrastructure spending, injecting $1 billion a year into the regions through the Provincial Growth Fund and in our first budget we announced the $5.5bn Families Package targeted at low-income New Zealanders. 
Together those measures will lift consumer spending and stimulate the real economy.
We are planning for our future, having restarted contributions to the Super Fund.
To help businesses invest and innovate we have introduced the R and D tax credit and have set money aside for a Green Investment Fund and we are in the midst of important tax review by the expert group led by Sir Michael Cullen.
There has been a lot of attention from the Opposition on headline business confidence surveys that frankly do not reflect the economic reality. 
It is what Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has described as the “business confidence paradox”. Most commentators have noted the political dimension of them as have a number of economists. They reflect “sadness” of some of those disappointed about the outcome. They hold a mirror up to the political leanings of respondents rather than the economic reality. 
They are proven to be a very poor predictor of the actual performance of the economy, as most economic commentators also acknowledge.
As the Prime Minister puts it: When you line up business confidence with key economic performance measures over the last two governments there appears to be an inverse relationship between business confidence and the actual performance of the economy.
For instance, average business confidence scores under the Clark/Cullen Government were much lower than the Key/English Government, despite Clark and Cullen delivering higher average growth, lower unemployment, lower debt, larger surpluses and stronger wage growth than their successors.
Since World War II growth rates have on average been higher under Labour. And for those with a long memory, Mr Muldoon was not from Labour.
The Prime Minister has put the low confidence surveys down to “uncertainty” and has moved to address those through a clear statement on workplace reforms and the appointment of a Business Advisory Council to complement the consultations we are undertaking with small and medium sized businesses.
The current macro indicators I have already mentioned point towards a positive picture. As Reserve Bank governor Adrian Orr said in August, “all signals are green for business investment”.
And as Sky City Chair Rob Campbell said recently said: “This is a great place to open and operate a business. Negativity is for those who stand on the side lines watching and commentating.”
 
And we have a good platform for future growth.
We enjoy strong institutions, clear legislation and effective regulation. That underpins long-term economic success by ensuring fairness and ease of doing business. In February, we were once again named the least corrupt country in the world by Berlin-based Transparency International. Our democracy is vibrant and our civil society is strong. In the longer term these are key to adherence to the rule of law, including contractual certainty, investment and p...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(51%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
