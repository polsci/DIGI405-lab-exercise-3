Te Papa -Thank you to everyone who has joined us today to examine how to create enabling environments that support Thriving Whānau.
I welcome Erena Mikaere - our Keynote speaker, from the Ruapehu Whānau Transformation Project.  This project is a great example of the strength of community to drive transformational change for whānau.  I will leave the outcomes for Erena to share.  But as we listen today I want us to reflect on what we can do to replicate these characteristics in our work across the public sector and alongside the philanthropic sector.  
I want to acknowledge the key characteristics of change:
Leadership, having a common purpose
Partnership (co-design), collaboration and inclusion

A whānau development approach will underpin how Te Puni Kōkiri will focus its efforts on supporting the aspirations, innovation and opportunities that will emerge from this approach to achieve intergenerational transformation.
This requires the Ministry to be connected to communities, knowledgeable about their realities, supportive of their ideas and resourceful in designing their own solutions.  Essentially being the waharoa to realising opportunities, not a gate.
Today is an opportunity to ask any questions, to explore ideas, and share your own experiences for whānau development.
Investing in the capability of a whānau development for iwi organisations is fundamental to long-term transformational change.  
When I think about the legacy contribution of Te Puea in my own community, the impact of her whānau-centric approach remains today.
Te Puni Kōkiri will also share their ‘whānau development’ learnings and how this has evolved their policy contribution and delivery approach to improve outcomes for whānau – but they cannot do it alone.  We need the entire public sector to support that shift, and the NGO sector need capacity investment to support that shift.
This Summit is a chance to wānanga a whānau-centred approach, how it works in practice and how you can apply this to your own organisation.
More importantly it is a chance for us to talk collectively about how government agencies and the philanthropic sector can work together in partnership with whānau to develop their development aspirations.  I guess it is a social impact investment opportunity that we are contributing to.
Many of the attendees at this Summit have been chosen because you are investment decision-makers and thought-leaders from across the public and philanthropic sectors.
Not only are Te Puni Kōkiri and the whānau representatives speaking today keen to share their experiences - Te Puni Kōkiri is also keen to work with you in future to support and implement a whānau-centred approach and determine a social impact investment approach. Thriving Whānau:  
Each whānau have their own context and experiences that shape their reality.
The whānau you will hear from today, and many others, are whānau with vision, aspiration, resilient, and deal with challenges and capitalise on opportunities.
They are thriving Māori Whānau resilient to the ups and downs of life.
Today you will gain some insights into the lives and actions of whānau who have aspired to take the lead, to seize the opportunity and to be innovative in building and sustaining wellbeing.
For example, we have
The Matekuare Whānau Trust in Te Whaiti not far from Minginui.  
The Waikai Whānau in Taupiri.  
The Turner Whānau in Ngaruawahia.  
The Tawhai Whānau in Hastings …. and
The Whareponga Papakāinga Trust on the East Coast.  

From Te Kāo in the Far North to Koukourata in the South.  We are supporting whānau to unlock the potential of their whenua through development in horticulture, honey, hemp and solar energy, to name a few, they are exploring it all.
Matekuare Whānau Trust: In Te Whaiti, a place you will travel through on your way to Minginui in the Central North Island, the Matekuare Whānau Trust looks after 50 hectares of Māori land.  There are around 67 owners and many whānau beneficiaries.  
The Trust have, out of the box, aspirations for their land which includes things like the development of a mind machinery zone, data enabled health proofed homes, alongside more conventional notions of development – commercial, agricultural and horticultural zones which includes goat milking.  
The initial Matekuare Trust engagement with Te Puni Kōkiri was initially about papakāinga development.  But their vision, as you can see, is for a ‘living village’, which is so much bigger than what Te Puni Kōkiri, as a single agency, can support.
As such our staff in the regions become the bridge, developing relationships with Councils to navigate resource consent processes, brokering relationships with tertiary institutions to create future proof homes, and helping unlock our own processes to get papakāinga built.  This is what whānau led development looks like.  This is what collaboration and co-design with whānau can lead to.
As separate departments and agencies, you will have specific focus areas, but you are all here today because you recognise the need to have wider awareness, perhaps more of a helicopter view and better coordination across your sectors.  You all recognise the potential to create better, more enduring, inter-generational outcomes for thriving whānau through this approach.
Given 219,122 hectares of Māori owned land has been identified for development under the Whēnua Māori, we will be looking to work collaboratively with many of you to realise the future sustainability from cultural wealth to economic development.  The potential of our collective prosperity is the responsibility of the collective and more particularly in the hands of whānau led solutions.  We acknowledge that there is still much to be done, but we must make every ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(47%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
