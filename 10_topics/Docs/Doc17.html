45th Anniversary of Diplomatic Relations Symposium.
Tuesday 5 December 2017, 9:15am, Hunter Council Chamber, Victoria University of Wellington.
Mr Xie Yuan, Vice President of Chinese People’s Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries
 It is a pleasure to join you in celebrating the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and the People’s Republic of China.
Of course, relations between our countries did not start with diplomats nor did they start only 45-years ago. 
New Zealand and China’s relations started in the 1800s with ordinary people who took pioneering journeys.  
The first Chinese immigrant to New Zealand, Appo Hocton, arrived 175 years ago in 1842. He jumped ship in the port of Nelson and became a successful businessman and a naturalised New Zealander.
90 years ago, a young sheep farmer from Taranaki set off, in his own words, to ‘go and have a look at the Chinese revolution’. Rewi Alley stayed in China for the rest of his life, receiving honorary citizenship in 1982.  
Rewi Alley would probably never have imagined that the 120th anniversary of his birth would be commemorated by an event attended by New Zealand’s Governor General.  Or that China’s President Xi Jinping  would call Rewi Alley - “our friend”.
In addition to Rewi Alley, there were many other New Zealanders who contributed to the early personal connections between New Zealand and China, and advocated for political recognition. These included members of the New Zealand China Friendship Society founded in 1952 and New Zealand MPs who visited China in their private capacities in the 1950s and 1960s. 
This engagement paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the governments of New Zealand and China on 22 December 1972.
In announcing diplomatic relations, the New Zealand Prime Minister of the time [Rt Hon Norman Kirk] stated: 
“China has now re-entered the mainstream of world affairs. It is playing an active part in the United Nations. In Asia and the Pacific its influence is great, and is bound to grow. It is logical and sensible for New Zealand to recognise the People’s Republic of China and enter into normal relations with it.” 
On 27 March 1973, a New Zealand Ministerial delegation, led by Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs Hon Joe Walding,  set foot on Chinese soil for the first time. 
The day before, the first staff of the Chinese Embassy arrived in Wellington.
And on 16 May 1973, the first Chinese Ambassador to New Zealand, Pei Jianzhang presented his credentials. 
The first New Zealand Ambassador to China, Bryce Harland, presented his credentials in Beijing on 20 September 1973. 
Official relations began from a low base. 
 The population of New Zealand was 2.97 million.  China’s was 865 million.
New Zealand’s total trade with China was just $1.7 million.  
New Zealand had no air links with China. The British enclave of Hong Kong was the entry point.
Forty-five years later, the situation couldn’t be more different.  
Today, the relationship between New Zealand and China is described as a comprehensive strategic partnership and there is plenty of evidence to support that. Our record of trade and economic “firsts” is dramatic.   New Zealand and China’s two-way trade now stands at NZ$24.4bn (year to June 2017).  China is New Zealand’s second largest trading partner and number one goods export market. China is New Zealand’s second-largest source of tourists, and China is New Zealand’s f...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(54%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(2%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
