E ngā mana,
E ngā reo,
E ngā karangatanga maha,
Tēnā koutou.
I have spoken these words in New Zealand’s indigenous language, te reo Māori. Te reo Māori is an official language in New Zealand and we are proud of it. We are working to ensure it is a thriving, living language. This is particularly appropriate given it is the International Year of Indigenous Languages.
Mr President, distinguished representatives of Member and Observer States of the Human Rights Council, I am honoured to be here for New Zealand’s third Universal Periodic Review.  
My name is Andrew Little and I am the Minister of Justice, for Courts, and Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations for the New Zealand Government.  I am also the Minister responsible for New Zealand’s intelligence agencies. 
I am joined today by:
Jillian Dempster, New Zealand’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva 
Andrew Kibblewhite, Chief Executive of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and 
Rajesh Chhana, Deputy Secretary, Justice Policy for our Ministry of Justice.
We look forward to engaging in an open discussion about New Zealand’s human rights record.
Changes since second UPR 
Since New Zealand’s second UPR in 2014, New Zealand has had significant political change.  After the General Election in September 2017, the New Zealand Labour Party formed a coalition Government with the New Zealand First Party and with the support of the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand.  This marked a change in direction after nine years of a centre-right Government.
Today I will share some of our human rights achievements, as well as acknowledge where we must still improve.  
I will discuss:
issues facing Māori, and how we are addressing social differences for, and discrimination against, the Māori population
how we are working to improve the wellbeing of New Zealanders and their families
our justice system and the challenges we face with high levels of incarceration
how we are addressing our high levels of family violence, and
issues facing women in New Zealand.  
These are also some of the key issues that were raised in our 2014 UPR examination.  Today, I will speak to our progress on the recommendations from that review, which are also discussed in our national report.  
Our report was drafted following a nationwide public consultation process to seek views on human rights issues that are important to New Zealanders.  We held public meetings across the country and visited secondary schools to hear from students and young people.  We welcomed the input from many civil society individuals and organisations into New Zealand’s UPR process and look forward to continuing to work together as we implement future recommendations.
I will first outline some important context. 
Context 
New Zealand is a diverse Pacific nation.  We are proudly multicultural, with over 200 ethnic groups and 160 languages.
New Zealand has specific constitutional relationships with the Cook Islands and Niue, as well as Tokelau, as part of the Realm of New Zealand.  
New Zealand has a long history of commitment to human rights and fair treatment for all our citizens.  We have actively participated in and supported the work of the United Nations. We are a small country, but we have never been afraid to speak out about what is just and right.   
New Zealand is also strongly committed to sustainable development at home and internationally, and supports the 2030 Agenda. 
The principles behind the Sustainable Development Goals are embedded in New Zealand’s domestic policies. The Goals also provide a framework for our international development cooperation, especially in the Pacific, and other international engagement.
 We often say that New Zealand is an egalitarian nation.  However, there are areas in which we are falling short of our aspirations and our reputation, which I will discuss today.
New Zealand is founded on a partnership between Māori, the tangata whenua, indigenous people, of New Zealand and the Crown (or Government).  In 1840 our founding constitutional document, Te Tiriti o Waitangi (the Treaty of Waitangi), was signed.  The intent was to formalise an enduring partnership between Māori and the Crown.  The Treaty encompasses both individual and collective rights and provides a framework for the State to promote, protect and respect indigen...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(36%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(35%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
