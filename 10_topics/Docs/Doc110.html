22 June 2018, 10.40 - 11.00 AM
Today we celebrate and continue a long tradition of Māori entrepreneurship and flair for business. 
Business acumen, trade, commerce, opportunity and innovation are things our tīpuna have mastered since…mai rānō. 
It was harakeke rope to  sealers then, it’s Mānuka honey to UK breakfast tables now. 
So I acknowledge all of you this morning who are following in the footsteps of those business dealers who have gone before you, and commend you as you carve out your own bright business careers for the future.
The focus today, is on boosting your business capability so that you can really get on with making your mark in te ao pakihi. 
And to those of you who are supporting and working with whānau to improve their business capability, I mihi to you as well. 
This year I have been privileged to be involved in a range of exciting and promising pākihi related kaupapa around the motu. They demonstrate how our communities and regions are brimming with potential and energy when it comes to business, for example;

the launch of the Waikato Region Māori Economic Action Plan and Agenda (Waikato)
the Māori Business Forum (Te Tau Ihu) 
the Māori Business Women Awards (Pōneke) 
the World Indigenous Tourism Forum (Paihia)
Te Hono National Summit (Tāmaki Makaurau)
the Māori Business Awards (Tāmaki Makaurau)
the Māori Economic Development Summit (Tāmaki Makaurau)
And now, here I am today, talking with you about Māori business and the impact we can make on economic development in Aotearoa. 
 
I know there are many more pakihi initiatives that have recently occurred – the Kōkiri Accelerator pitches in Tāmaki Makaurau, and the Rangatahi Business challenges throughout the motu to name a few. 
As Minister for Māori Development and Local Government my focus is on achieving positive whānau development outcomes throughout the country. These workshops are a way for you to learn more about operating a business and ask for specific support wherever you may be in your business development journey. We can work together to drive collective impact – we just need to be smart about how we incentivise it. For example, 
 
exploring open procurement policies to put money back into the community – so you can do what you do best and focus on the people within your community. 
working with the tax working group to examine further improvements in the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. 
looking at sustainable options to transition into a low carbon economy. 
advancing economic development - making sure that Māori benefit from our Government’s priorities such as the Provincial Growth Fund and Trade for All Agenda.There are opportunities for iwi, Māori Authorities, incorporations and trusts as well as Māori businesses to:
work together to address issues such as scale, skills and knowledge in an increasingly competitive global environment, and make the most of our ‘Māori edge’
innovate and think about new and knowledge intensive sectors such as information technology
use and manage resources in ways that are founded in kaupapa Māori and that contribute to Māori economic success
lift capability, across governance, management and the Māori workforce.
The national Māori economic development strategy – He kai kei aku ringa is a plan to help you on your journey. It is a proud sponsor of this kaupapa.It is also through other funds, such as the Māori Innovation Fund, the He ai kei aku ringa Fund and the Māori Development Fund that these kaupapa can happen. We know these funds are beneficial because we have seen an overwhelming demand from whānau to support their innovative ideas and projects.  He kai kei aku ringa se...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(42%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(26%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(3%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(2%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
