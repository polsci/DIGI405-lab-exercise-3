First, let’s start by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land that we meet on and pay respects to their elders, past and present.
Thank you, Sabra Lane, National Press Club Chair and ABC Chief Political Correspondent, for your invitation to speak here today. 
One can’t but reflect on the last 36 hours in Australian politics, given that tomorrow morning we fly to Vanuatu where issues such as political stability will be discussed.
When staff suggested we should tackle the topic of “working together” what flashes through one’s mind is a first experience of working with Australians. It’s of a young New Zealander seeking to make his way in the world.  And that transpired to being given a job, working first for BHP in Newcastle on the blast furnace floor and then deep in a tunnel in the Snowy Mountains.
It was hard, hot, physical and very dangerous work. It taught much about Australia, its development, and about being a labourer. It also led to a decision to go to law school and become a politician – it was easier.  
This visit to Canberra is the six monthly foreign ministers meeting with the Hon Julie Bishop. She visited New Zealand in February and we see each other regularly at the various international forums we both attend.
Today’s discussions with the Minister, and her colleagues, were productive, as in fact they usually are. When we say we have a “good working relationship” that actually does mean we have a “good working relationship.”
One small fact worth noting is that on this day twelve months ago the New Zealand Parliament was dissolved. It was the first step on the path to a General Election which delivered the Labour – New Zealand First Coalition Government in which one is privileged to serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.
And so our purpose here today, nearly one year into our government’s administration, is to state how important and productive the Australia-New Zealand relationship remains, regardless of what differences we may have.  
And to also emphasise the importance of Australia and New Zealand working together in our Pacific neighbourhood at a time of remarkable, sometimes alarming, change.
Neighbours
As our biggest economic partner, and home to more than half a million Kiwis, Australia matters more to us than we do to you.  Even so, it bears recalling that our size and single market means New Zealand adds another “Queensland” to the Australian economy.
More Australian businesses export to New Zealand than any other destination, making our market essential to 18,000 of your small and medium sized enterprises and their employees.
Perhaps as importantly for the political animals amongst us, poll after poll shows Australians and New Zealanders feel more fondly about one another than we do about any other country on earth.
That affinity does not mean we always agree with one another.  A hallmark of a healthy, vibrant relationship is our capacity to embrace difference and to deal with disagreement in a calm, productive fashion. This is true of the way in which we are approaching our differences of view over the treatment of some New Zealanders living in Australia.  
While we understand and respect your Government’s right to set its own policies on foreign criminals, many New Zealanders question the deportation of Kiwi passport holders to a country they may never really have known because they left at such a young age.  And our attention cannot but be drawn by the deportation of people who have not yet been found guilty of crimes in an Australian court of law.
Now, protection of the community is a core responsibility of any government and we are not suggesting these cases are clear cut.  But New Zealanders’ sense of injustice is rooted in the fact the half a million Kiwis living in Australia are overwhelmingly contributors to your society.  
New Zealanders living here have higher incomes and are more likely to be in full time employment than even Australian nationals.  And they pay more taxes per head than any other members of Australian society.  So the case for giving them a fair go - or as Australians sometimes put it - giving us a fair suck of the sav, is very strong indeed.
And the best argument we have to offer is an argument on legal principle. We both have judicial systems which have evolved from the British legal tradition. It a tradition which developed the important concepts of natural justice and habeas corpus. These are not concepts we should lose sight of. 
Delivering direction in diplomacy, development and defence
In the ten months since our Government was sworn in, we have put momentum behind our diplomacy, our development assistance, and our defence force.
We have initiated a Pacific reset to seek greater engagement and influence in the region. Our words are being followed by resources. We have shifted the dial with a 30% increase in New Zealand’s development assistance budget over the next three years.
Of course New Zealand has global interests as well. Our government is also reinvesting in our diplomatic capability.  This year we provided funding to create fifty new full time positions in our Foreign Ministry to reinforce our diplomatic presence. At a time of global turbulence we must ensure New Zealand’s voice is both present and heard.
New Zealand has also reviewed its defence policy settings.  Last month, we released our Strategic Defence Policy Statement. It describes the significant changes in New Zealand’s (and Australia’s) strategic environment that we need to respond to. Challenges once conceived as “future trends” have become today’s realities. Great power competition is back, rules and norms that defined the global and regional order are under pressure, and the impacts of climate change are tang...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(58%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>zealand pacific defence security region foreign international world values climate global countries states change policy challenges partners nations united interests</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>government public work wellbeing system zealand service approach people important violence change support ensure communities sector policy working services social</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>government economy zealand growth economic budget years investment work year sustainable million make zealanders future business infrastructure support term billion</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>women police rights justice today human zealand men family day victims time parliament court history tēnā koutou te law role</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(4%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>digital government zealand sector business work businesses industry technology opportunities future media world economy skills people small innovation make working</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(1%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>pacific tourism zealand people aotearoa le language visitors culture year samoa cultural ma communities peoples languages future fa community today</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic0.html>health people education children system work housing ve mental support child care zealand years today poverty young families year māori</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>zealand trade climate china change world global emissions countries agreement economic rules year carbon energy minister international wto trading relationship</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>māori te water local development environmental land infrastructure urban environment whānau iwi government indigenous communities change councils freshwater country challenges</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(0%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>industry tax fisheries zealand racing report management revenue system group innovation recommendations waste year fishing future officials levy products aquaculture</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
